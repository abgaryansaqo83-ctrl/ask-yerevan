<h2>About AskYerevan bot and website</h2>

<p>AskYerevan is a website, Telegram bot and community about Yerevan and Armenia. In one place you will find 
  landmarks, churches, cultural events, cafés, bars, restaurants and everyday useful information about the 
  city and the country.</p>
<p>Our goal is to help both locals and visitors quickly find answers to questions like “Where to go today?”, 
  “What to see in Armenia?” and “Where to find useful local services?” without scrolling through dozens of 
  different pages.</p>

<h3>What the bot does</h3>
<p>The Telegram bot answers many questions about Yerevan and Armenia through a smart Q&A experience. It shows 
  upcoming events, reminds you about interesting places in the city and helps you choose where to go in the 
  evening or on weekends.</p>
<p>In the morning, the bot posts a short daily update in the group with the weather and interesting events – cinema, 
  theatre, concerts, city initiatives, restaurant and bar ideas – so you can start the day with a ready plan.</p>

<h3>Telegram group and community</h3>
<p>The AskYerevan Telegram group is a live community where people publish buy & sell listings, apartment rental 
  offers and requests, job offers and job‑seeking posts, as well as chat freely in a dedicated discussion thread.</p>
<p>The bot works directly inside the group: in the same place you can ask questions about Yerevan and Armenia, 
  get automatic recommendations and discover useful listings shared by the community.</p>

<h3>The AskYerevan website</h3>
<p>The website has dedicated sections for landmarks in Yerevan and Armenia, Armenian historical and modern churches, 
  walking routes, cafés, bars, restaurants and other places to spend your time. Each page includes photos, a short 
  story and often practical tips such as how to get there, when it is best to visit and what not to miss.</p>
<p>The website and the bot work together as a single system, allowing people to explore the city, receive live advice 
  from the community and quickly share information with each other.</p>
