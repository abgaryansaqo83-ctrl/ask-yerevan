      <h2>Holy Etchmiadzin Cathedral</h2>

      <h3>Foundation (4th century)</h3>
      <p>
        Holy Etchmiadzin Cathedral took shape in the 4th century, when Armenia was one of the first countries
        to adopt Christianity as a state religion.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to tradition, Saint Gregory the Illuminator had a vision in which Christ descended from heaven
        and struck the ground with a golden hammer, showing the place where the cathedral should be built.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name “Etchmiadzin” literally means “the Only‑Begotten descended”.
      </p>

      <h3>Rebuilding and strengthening</h3>
      <p>
        Between the 5th and 7th centuries the cathedral was rebuilt and reinforced several times, and under
        Catholicos Komitas A Aghtsetsi it received the cruciform domed layout that has survived to this day.
      </p>

      <h3>From the Middle Ages to the modern era</h3>
      <p>
        In the 17th century a belfry and other monastic buildings were added, and in the 19th century new
        educational and cultural institutions were built around the complex, turning Etchmiadzin into a major
        spiritual and cultural center for Armenians.
      </p>

      <h3>Recent period</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2000, Holy Etchmiadzin Cathedral and the nearby churches have been inscribed on the UNESCO
        World Heritage List, and the cathedral remains the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians and the
        main shrine of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
      </p>

      <h3>Did you know?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Etchmiadzin is considered one of the oldest cathedrals in continuous use in the Christian world.</li>
        <li>The cathedral treasures a number of important Christian relics and liturgical objects.</li>
        <li>For centuries it has been a key symbol of Armenian identity, faith and statehood.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Etchmiadzin is not just an ancient monument, but a living place where faith, history and the present meet.

    </div>
    <div class="church-text">
      <h2>Octagonal Church of Artashat</h2>

      <h3>Location and discovery</h3>
      <p>
        The remains of the octagonal church were discovered at ancient Artashat–Artaxata, which served as
        one of Armenia’s capitals in the Hellenistic and early Christian periods.
        The church stood on a hillside and occupied about 1000 square meters.
      </p>

      <h3>Dating and significance</h3>
      <p>
        Radiocarbon analysis of wooden fragments shows that the church was built in the first half of the
        4th century, making it one of the earliest archaeologically documented churches in Armenia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The octagonal plan with cross‑shaped extensions is typical of early Christian memorial or martyr churches,
        so it is assumed that the building may have marked the grave of a martyr.
      </p>

      <h3>Architectural features</h3>
      <p>
        The octagonal core has a diameter of about 30 meters and was built of local stone and lime mortar,
        with a simple floor and terracotta tiles inside.
      </p>

      <h3>Trace of early Christianity in Armenia</h3>
      <p>
        The octagonal church of Artashat is an important proof that Christian worship was firmly established
        here already in the early 4th century and shows architectural links between Armenia and the eastern
        Mediterranean world.

      <h3>Location and foundation</h3>
      <p>
        Saint Hripsime Church stands in Vagharshapat near the spiritual center of Etchmiadzin, on the site where,
        according to tradition, the martyr virgin Hripsime is buried.
      </p>

      <h3>Construction (618)</h3>
      <p>
        The present stone church was built in 618 under Catholicos Komitas A Aghtsetsi and is one of the
        classic examples of early medieval Armenian domed centralized churches.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        Its cruciform domed plan and clear volumes strongly influenced later Armenian church architecture.
      </p>

      <h3>Heritage</h3>
      <p>
        Saint Hripsime is part of the UNESCO World Heritage listing “Cathedral and Churches of Etchmiadzin and

      </p>

      <h3>Construction (630)</h3>
      <p>
        The present church was built in 630 under Catholicos Ezra on the site of a smaller memorial chapel
        and has largely preserved its original form.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture</h3>

      <h3>Early Christian tradition and a 17th‑century church</h3>

      <p>
        Khor Virap is located near ancient Artashat, at the foot of Mount Ararat, and is associated with the
        famous story of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, who, according to tradition, was imprisoned here in a
        deep pit for about thirteen years before King Tiridates III converted and Armenia became the first
        officially Christian state.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sources mention a small Christian church here as early as the 4th–5th centuries, and in the 7th century
        a small chapel of Saint George was built on the site.
      </p>

      <p>
        The present monastery complex was formed in the 17th century with the construction of the Surb Astvatsatsin
        Church, monastic cells and walls; today Khor Virap is one of Armenia’s most visited pilgrimage sites,
        famous for its classic view of Ararat.

      <h2>Sevanavank Monastery</h2>
      <h3>Foundation and from island to peninsula</h3>

      <p>
        Sevanavank stands on a rocky height on the northwestern shore of Lake Sevan which, until the mid‑20th
        century, was a real island separated from the mainland by deep water.
        According to an inscription, the monastery was founded by Princess Mariam, daughter of King Ashot of
        the Bagratuni dynasty, who built the churches of the Holy Apostles and the Holy Mother of God.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tradition holds that an earlier Christian chapel was built here already in the 4th century at the
        initiative of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, and in the 9th century the monastery became a fortress and
        learning center of the Syunik princes, with its own school and scriptorium.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Soviet period the water level of Lake Sevan was lowered and the island turned into a peninsula;
        today a short stairway leads up to the monastery with wide views over the lake. Sevanavank was restored
        mainly in the mid‑20th century and again became an active spiritual center in the 1990s.

      <h2>Geghard Monastery</h2>
      <h3>A rock‑carved monastery and the legend of the Holy Lance</h3>

      <p>
        Geghard Monastery lies deep in the Upper Azat Valley, pressed against
        steep cliffs so that much of the complex seems to grow out of the rock
        itself. Its name comes from the “Holy Geghard”, the lance that, according
        to tradition, pierced Christ’s side and was once kept here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the walls you find both free‑standing churches and fully
        rock‑cut chapels whose domes and vaults are carved directly into the
        mountain. In one of the cave halls, if you look up you see a round
        opening in the ceiling where a beam of light falls into the dark space
        like a spotlight.
      </p>

      <h3>History and dating</h3>
      <p>
        The earliest foundations at Geghard go back at least to the 4th century,
        while the main church of the Holy Mother of God dates from the 13th
        century, built under the Zakarian princes. At that time the site became
        a fortified monastery with walls, gates and inner courtyards.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and cave chambers</h3>
      <p>
        Geghard combines several worlds in one place: classical Armenian
        cross‑domed architecture, deep cave chapels with carved columns and
        walls covered in khachkars and inscriptions, and an open courtyard
        that suddenly reveals the dramatic canyon of the Azat River.
      </p>

      <h3>UNESCO site today</h3>
      <p>
        Geghard Monastery and the Upper Azat Valley are inscribed on the UNESCO
        World Heritage List as a unique blend of landscape and spiritual heritage.
        The monastery is still active, and the views from the surrounding slopes
        over the cliffs and the valley make it one of the most impressive stops
        in Armenia.

      <h2>Noravank Monastery</h2>
      <h3>A monastery hidden in a red-rock gorge</h3>

      <p>
        Noravank is tucked deep inside the Amaghu Gorge, hemmed in by steep
        red cliffs so that the monastery seems to be growing out of the rock
        itself. As you drive into the gorge the road narrows,
        and at the very end a small plateau opens up with the monastery complex.
      </p>

      <p>
        The core of the complex dates from the 13th century, when the churches
        of Surb Karapet and the small two-storey Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother
        of God) were built, along with chapels and halls linked to the Orbelian
        princely family.
      </p>

      <h3>Orbelian tombs and the two-storey church</h3>
      <p>
        The compact Surb Astvatsatsin church, with a burial chamber on the
        lower level and a small sanctuary above, is one of Noravank’s most
        iconic buildings. The narrow external stairway leading to the upper
        floor is a favourite photo spot and a good example of how medieval
        Armenian architects played with form and symbolism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tombstones of the Orbelian princes, khachkars and long inscriptions on
        the walls show how Noravank functioned not only as a spiritual center
        but also as a regional political hub in southern Armenia.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and landscape</h3>
      <p>
        Almost completely surrounded by cliffs, Noravank changes character with
        the light: in the early morning it feels cool and quiet, while at sunset
        the red rocks glow and the whole complex turns golden.
      </p>

      <h3>Noravank today</h3>
      <p>
        Today Noravank is one of Armenia’s most visited monasteries; it is often
        combined with Garni and Geghard or with trips further south toward Syunik,
        making it a perfect stop between Yerevan and the southern regions.

      <h2>Tatev Monastery</h2>
      <h3>A cliff-edge monastery above the Vorotan Gorge</h3>

      <p>
        Tatev Monastery sits dramatically on the edge of the deep Vorotan Gorge,
        on a rocky plateau from which the cliffs drop almost vertically down
        into the valley. From above, the complex looks like a
        compact fortress guarding the surrounding landscape.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main core of the monastery was formed in the 9th–10th centuries and
        includes the church of Saints Paul and Peter, the church of Saint Gregory,
        chapels, monastic cells and courtyards, all enclosed by defensive walls.
      </p>

      <h3>Medieval university and center of learning</h3>
      <p>
        In the 14th–15th centuries Tatev was famous for its university, one of the
        most important centers of scholarship and manuscript production in medieval
        Armenia. Scholars taught theology, philosophy, arts and
        sciences here, and many illuminated manuscripts were created in its scriptorium.
      </p>

      <p>
        Walking around the complex today, you can still sense this academic past in
        the remains of the library, classrooms and residential cells around the
        main courtyard.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and the “swinging column”</h3>
      <p>
        Tatev is also known for its so‑called swinging or rocking column, a stone
        pillar that is sensitive to small movements and is thought to have served
        as an early warning device or simply as an ingenious architectural feature.
      </p>

      <h3>Wings of Tatev ropeway</h3>
      <p>
        Today many visitors reach Tatev via the “Wings of Tatev” aerial tramway,
        one of the world’s longest reversible cableways, which connects the village
        of Halidzor with the monastery across the gorge.
        The 12‑minute ride offers sweeping views of the cliffs and brings the
        monastery slowly closer from above.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, the medieval monastery, the dramatic gorge and the modern ropeway
        make Tatev one of the absolute highlights of southern Armenia.

      <h2>Haghpat Monastery</h2>
      <h3>A Bagratid-era center of learning above the Debed Gorge</h3>

      <p>
        Haghpat Monastery stands on a plateau above the Debed Gorge in northern
        Armenia, surrounded by green hills and deep valleys.
        It was founded in the 10th century under the Bagratid kings and soon
        became one of medieval Armenia’s key spiritual and educational centers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main church, Surb Nshan (Holy Sign), was built between 976 and 991
        on the order of Queen Khosrovanush, and in later centuries a large
        gavit, belfry, scriptorium and other monastic buildings were added
        around it.
      </p>

      <h3>Gavit, scriptorium and khachkars</h3>
      <p>
        Haghpat is famous for its spacious gavit, which served both as a
        gathering place and as a space for teaching; the monastery’s scriptorium
        was an important center for copying and illuminating manuscripts.
        Numerous khachkars and long inscriptions record the names of benefactors
        and monks over the centuries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moving through the passages and small courtyards, you feel that this was
        once an entire monastic “village” with living quarters, workrooms and
        study spaces, not just a single church.
      </p>

      <h3>UNESCO together with Sanahin</h3>
      <p>
        Haghpat and nearby Sanahin Monastery together form a single UNESCO World
        Heritage Site as outstanding examples of Bagratid-period Armenian
        architecture. The two complexes stand on opposite
        sides of the Debed Gorge and are usually visited on the same trip.
      </p>

      <h3>Haghpat today</h3>
      <p>
        Today Haghpat remains a functioning monastery, but it also feels like a
        quiet rural place with grass-covered roofs, stone paths and often a
        slightly misty sky. It captures the atmosphere of the
        Lori region in a very concentrated way.

      <h2>Sanahin Monastery</h2>
      <h3>A medieval learning center hidden in the mountains of Lori</h3>

      <p>
        Sanahin Monastery stands on a high plateau above the Debed Gorge in
        northern Armenia, very close to Haghpat, and together they form a
        single UNESCO World Heritage Site.
        Founded in the 10th century, Sanahin became one of the key spiritual
        and educational centers of Bagratid Armenia.
      </p>

      <p>
        At its core are the churches of the Holy Mother of God and the
        All-Saviour, around which gavits, chapels, a scriptorium, monastic
        cells and a belfry were added over the centuries.
      </p>

      <h3>Place of learning and manuscripts</h3>
      <p>
        In the Middle Ages Sanahin was home to a school and scriptorium where
        scholars worked on theology, philosophy and the sciences, and where
        many finely illuminated manuscripts were produced.
        The remains of study rooms and library spaces still hint at this
        intellectual life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Walking through the courtyards you notice numerous khachkars, stone
        benches and old trees that contribute to the feeling of a living,
        open-air museum.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and atmosphere</h3>
      <p>
        Built mostly of dark basalt, the churches of Sanahin have strong, austere
        volumes that sit perfectly in the often misty, overcast landscape of
        the Lori highlands.
        Inside, the spaces are dim and the light enters through small windows
        and oculi in the domes, creating a very contemplative mood.
      </p>

      <h3>Part of a UNESCO pair</h3>
      <p>
        Together with nearby Haghpat, Sanahin is inscribed on the UNESCO World
        Heritage List as an outstanding example of medieval Armenian monastic
        architecture.
        Most visitors see both monasteries in a single trip, gaining a good
        sense of the monastic culture of the Debed Canyon.

      <h2>Haghartsin Monastery</h2>
      <h3>A forest monastery in the hills of Dilijan</h3>

      <p>
        Haghartsin Monastery lies deep in the forests of Dilijan National Park,
        in a small valley where the surrounding slopes are densely covered with
        trees.
        Most of the complex was built in the 12th–13th centuries and is linked
        to local princes and important clerics of the Tavush region.
      </p>

      <p>
        The complex includes several churches—Surb Grigor, Surb Stepanos and
        Surb Astvatsatsin—together with a gavit, refectory, monks’ cells and
        service buildings that form a small monastic “village” in the woods.
      </p>

      <h3>Pilgrimage site and place to relax</h3>

      <p>
        Today Haghartsin is both a place of worship and one of the most popular
        stops around Dilijan; in the courtyard you will often see pilgrims and
        travelers resting under the trees or wandering among the khachkars.
      </p>

      <p>
        The combination of dense forest, cool air and dark stone buildings gives
        Haghartsin a very tranquil, almost secluded atmosphere, quite different
        from the open landscapes of the Ararat plain.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and restoration</h3>
      <p>
        The churches follow the classical Armenian cross‑domed type but with
        relatively simple exteriors that focus attention on the stone, the
        proportions and the surrounding nature rather than on heavy decoration.
        In recent decades Haghartsin has undergone significant restoration and
        is now much easier to access than it used to be.

      <h2>Goshavank Monastery</h2>
      <h3>Mkhitar Gosh’s monastery and a cradle of medieval law</h3>

      <p>
        Goshavank stands above the village of Gosh in Tavush province, in a
        forested area east of Dilijan.
        It was built in the 12th–13th centuries on the site of the older Getik
        Monastery, which had been destroyed by an earthquake.
      </p>

      <p>
        The complex is closely associated with Mkhitar Gosh, the medieval
        scholar and jurist whose famous Lawcode was compiled here, making
        Goshavank an important center of Armenian legal and theological thought.
        A statue of Mkhitar Gosh stands in the monastery courtyard.
      </p>

      <h3>Churches, gavit and khachkars</h3>
      <p>
        The main buildings include the large Surb Astvatsatsin church, the
        smaller Surb Grigor church, a gavit, former school buildings and
        various service and residential structures.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of Armenia’s most famous khachkars, known for its incredibly fine
        carving, stands at Goshavank and is often cited as a masterpiece of
        Armenian stonework.
      </p>

      <h3>Gosh Lake and the landscape</h3>
      <p>
        Many visitors combine Goshavank with a short hike to nearby Gosh Lake,
        using forest paths that link the monastery and the lake.
        This makes Goshavank both a cultural and a nature stop on trips around
        Dilijan and Tavush.

      <h2>Zvartnots Cathedral</h2>
      <h3>A circular cathedral that now survives as a luminous ruin</h3>

      <p>
        Zvartnots Cathedral stands in an open field near Vagharshapat, where a ring
        of broken columns and arches rises under the sky and, on clear days, Mount
        Ararat appears on the horizon.
        Even in ruins it feels surprisingly modern and experimental, as if it were
        a bold architectural project ahead of its time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project is associated with Catholicos Nerses, often called “the Builder”,
        who wanted a unique circular cathedral that could host important ceremonies
        and receive high-ranking guests.
        Zvartnots was conceived less as a village church and more as a symbolic
        centerpiece for the Etchmiadzin area.
      </p>

      <h3>Name and idea of light</h3>
      <p>
        The name “Zvartnots” is linked to the word “zvart”, meaning joyful or bright,
        and to the idea of “zvartats”, the heavenly hosts or angels, which gives
        the name a sense of “dwelling place of the angels”.
        With its circular plan, open colonnades and light filtering from above,
        the cathedral was designed as a space where architecture and light work
        together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many guides like to say that Zvartnots is more about light than walls, and
        even today, in its ruined state, that feeling is still very present.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and appearance</h3>
      <p>
        Zvartnots is known for its circular ground plan and several concentric
        rings of columns that once supported a high central structure.
        The reconstructed outlines of the foundations and the surviving carved
        blocks give visitors a good sense of the original volume.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around the site you can see finely carved capitals, friezes and khachkars,
        which show how richly decorated the cathedral must have been.
      </p>

      <h3>Ruin, museum and UNESCO</h3>
      <p>
        Over time the cathedral collapsed and remained a ruin until archaeological
        excavations uncovered the foundations and many architectural fragments.
        Today Zvartnots is an open-air museum with a small indoor exhibition that
        displays finds, models and drawings of different reconstructions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together with the cathedral and churches of Etchmiadzin, Zvartnots is part
        of a single UNESCO World Heritage Site and is usually visited on the same
        day as the Mother Cathedral, Saint Hripsime and Saint Gayane.

      <h2>Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral</h2>
      <h3>A modern symbol for 1700 years of Christianity</h3>

      <p>
        Rising on a small hill in Yerevan, Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral is the largest Armenian
        Apostolic church in the world and the spiritual “new heart” of the capital. It was built between
        1997 and 2001 and consecrated in 2001 on the occasion of the 1700th anniversary of Christianity
        as Armenia’s state religion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The complex includes the main cathedral with around 1700 seats and two smaller chapels dedicated to
        King Tiridates III and Queen Ashkhen. Relics of Saint Gregory the Illuminator were brought here from
        Naples and placed in a special reliquary, and shortly after the consecration the cathedral was visited
        by Pope John Paul II.
      </p>

      <p>
        Architecturally, the building combines traditional Armenian forms with clean, modern lines, creating
        a wide, light‑filled interior that feels both monumental and calm. Standing in the open courtyard
        under the 54‑meter bell tower, you see the whole of Yerevan spread out below and, on clear days,
        Mount Ararat on the horizon.

      <h2>Saint Anna Church</h2>
      <h3>A quiet courtyard in the heart of Yerevan</h3>

      <p>
        Saint Anna Church sits right in the center of Yerevan on Abovyan Street, yet as soon as you pass
        through the gate the city noise stays outside and a calm stone courtyard opens up. The church was
        built between 2011 and 2014 and consecrated in 2015 as part of a single complex together with the
        tiny 13th‑century Katoghike Church just a few meters away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its architecture combines a classic Armenian cruciform plan and dome with clean contemporary lines
        and warm pink tuff stone, so it feels both traditional and perfectly at home in today’s city. On one
        side of the courtyard rises the Catholicosate residence, which adds a sense of importance, but the
        atmosphere remains intimate and welcoming.
      </p>

      <p>
        Saint Anna is especially atmospheric at dusk, when the facades and the passages around Katoghike are
        softly lit and the city’s noise turns into a distant background. It is the kind of place where you may
        enter “just to have a look” and end up sitting on a bench for half an hour, watching people pass through
        the courtyard and feeling old and new Yerevan merge in one frame.
