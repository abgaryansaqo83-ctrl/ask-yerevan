      <h2>Holy Etchmiadzin Cathedral</h2>

      <h3>Foundation (4th century)</h3>
      <p>
        Holy Etchmiadzin Cathedral took shape in the 4th century, when Armenia was one of the first countries
        to adopt Christianity as a state religion.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to tradition, Saint Gregory the Illuminator had a vision in which Christ descended from heaven
        and struck the ground with a golden hammer, showing the place where the cathedral should be built.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name “Etchmiadzin” literally means “the Only‑Begotten descended”.
      </p>

      <h3>Rebuilding and strengthening</h3>
      <p>
        Between the 5th and 7th centuries the cathedral was rebuilt and reinforced several times, and under
        Catholicos Komitas A Aghtsetsi it received the cruciform domed layout that has survived to this day.
      </p>

      <h3>From the Middle Ages to the modern era</h3>
      <p>
        In the 17th century a belfry and other monastic buildings were added, and in the 19th century new
        educational and cultural institutions were built around the complex, turning Etchmiadzin into a major
        spiritual and cultural center for Armenians.
      </p>

      <h3>Recent period</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2000, Holy Etchmiadzin Cathedral and the nearby churches have been inscribed on the UNESCO
        World Heritage List, and the cathedral remains the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians and the
        main shrine of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
      </p>

      <h3>Did you know?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Etchmiadzin is considered one of the oldest cathedrals in continuous use in the Christian world.</li>
        <li>The cathedral treasures a number of important Christian relics and liturgical objects.</li>
        <li>For centuries it has been a key symbol of Armenian identity, faith and statehood.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Etchmiadzin is not just an ancient monument, but a living place where faith, history and the present meet.

    <div class="church-text">
      <h2>Octagonal Church of Artashat</h2>

      <h3>Location and discovery</h3>
      <p>
        The remains of the octagonal church were discovered at ancient Artashat–Artaxata, which served as
        one of Armenia’s capitals in the Hellenistic and early Christian periods.
        The church stood on a hillside and occupied about 1000 square meters.
      </p>

      <h3>Dating and significance</h3>
      <p>
        Radiocarbon analysis of wooden fragments shows that the church was built in the first half of the
        4th century, making it one of the earliest archaeologically documented churches in Armenia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The octagonal plan with cross‑shaped extensions is typical of early Christian memorial or martyr churches,
        so it is assumed that the building may have marked the grave of a martyr.
      </p>

      <h3>Architectural features</h3>
      <p>
        The octagonal core has a diameter of about 30 meters and was built of local stone and lime mortar,
        with a simple floor and terracotta tiles inside.
      </p>

      <h3>Trace of early Christianity in Armenia</h3>
      <p>
        The octagonal church of Artashat is an important proof that Christian worship was firmly established
        here already in the early 4th century and shows architectural links between Armenia and the eastern
        Mediterranean world.

      <p>
        Saint Hripsime Church stands in Vagharshapat near the spiritual center of Etchmiadzin, on the site where,
        according to tradition, the martyr virgin Hripsime is buried.
      </p>

      <h3>Construction (618)</h3>
      <p>
        The present stone church was built in 618 under Catholicos Komitas A Aghtsetsi and is one of the
        classic examples of early medieval Armenian domed centralized churches.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        Its cruciform domed plan and clear volumes strongly influenced later Armenian church architecture.
      </p>

      <h3>Heritage</h3>
      <p>
        Saint Hripsime is part of the UNESCO World Heritage listing “Cathedral and Churches of Etchmiadzin and

        The present church was built in 630 under Catholicos Ezra on the site of a smaller memorial chapel
        and has largely preserved its original form.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        It is a three‑aisled domed basilica with four interior pillars and is considered one of the best

      <h3>Early Christian tradition and a 17th‑century church</h3>

      <p>
        Khor Virap is located near ancient Artashat, at the foot of Mount Ararat, and is associated with the
        famous story of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, who, according to tradition, was imprisoned here in a
        deep pit for about thirteen years before King Tiridates III converted and Armenia became the first
        officially Christian state.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sources mention a small Christian church here as early as the 4th–5th centuries, and in the 7th century
        a small chapel of Saint George was built on the site.
      </p>

      <p>
        The present monastery complex was formed in the 17th century with the construction of the Surb Astvatsatsin
        Church, monastic cells and walls; today Khor Virap is one of Armenia’s most visited pilgrimage sites,
        famous for its classic view of Ararat.

      <h2>Sevanavank Monastery</h2>
      <h3>Foundation and from island to peninsula</h3>

      <p>
        Sevanavank stands on a rocky height on the northwestern shore of Lake Sevan which, until the mid‑20th
        century, was a real island separated from the mainland by deep water.
        According to an inscription, the monastery was founded by Princess Mariam, daughter of King Ashot of
        the Bagratuni dynasty, who built the churches of the Holy Apostles and the Holy Mother of God.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tradition holds that an earlier Christian chapel was built here already in the 4th century at the
        initiative of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, and in the 9th century the monastery became a fortress and
        learning center of the Syunik princes, with its own school and scriptorium.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Soviet period the water level of Lake Sevan was lowered and the island turned into a peninsula;
        today a short stairway leads up to the monastery with wide views over the lake. Sevanavank was restored
        mainly in the mid‑20th century and again became an active spiritual center in the 1990s.

      <h2>Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral</h2>
      <h3>A modern symbol for 1700 years of Christianity</h3>

      <p>
        Rising on a small hill in Yerevan, Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral is the largest Armenian
        Apostolic church in the world and the spiritual “new heart” of the capital. It was built between
        1997 and 2001 and consecrated in 2001 on the occasion of the 1700th anniversary of Christianity
        as Armenia’s state religion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The complex includes the main cathedral with around 1700 seats and two smaller chapels dedicated to
        King Tiridates III and Queen Ashkhen. Relics of Saint Gregory the Illuminator were brought here from
        Naples and placed in a special reliquary, and shortly after the consecration the cathedral was visited
        by Pope John Paul II.
      </p>

      <p>
        Architecturally, the building combines traditional Armenian forms with clean, modern lines, creating
        a wide, light‑filled interior that feels both monumental and calm. Standing in the open courtyard
        under the 54‑meter bell tower, you see the whole of Yerevan spread out below and, on clear days,
        Mount Ararat on the horizon.

      <h2>Saint Anna Church</h2>
      <h3>A quiet courtyard in the heart of Yerevan</h3>

      <p>
        Saint Anna Church sits right in the center of Yerevan on Abovyan Street, yet as soon as you pass
        through the gate the city noise stays outside and a calm stone courtyard opens up. The church was
        built between 2011 and 2014 and consecrated in 2015 as part of a single complex together with the
        tiny 13th‑century Katoghike Church just a few meters away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its architecture combines a classic Armenian cruciform plan and dome with clean contemporary lines
        and warm pink tuff stone, so it feels both traditional and perfectly at home in today’s city. On one
        side of the courtyard rises the Catholicosate residence, which adds a sense of importance, but the
        atmosphere remains intimate and welcoming.
      </p>

      <p>
        Saint Anna is especially atmospheric at dusk, when the facades and the passages around Katoghike are
        softly lit and the city’s noise turns into a distant background. It is the kind of place where you may
        enter “just to have a look” and end up sitting on a bench for half an hour, watching people pass through
        the courtyard and feeling old and new Yerevan merge in one frame.
