      <h2>Etchmiadzin Mother Cathedral</h2>

      <h3>Foundation (4th century)</h3>
      <p>
        Etchmiadzin Mother Cathedral took shape in the 4th century, 
        when Armenia became one of the first states to adopt Christianity as a state religion.
        According to tradition, Saint Gregory the Illuminator saw a vision of 
        Christ descending from heaven and striking the ground with a golden hammer, 
        marking the place where the cathedral should be built.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name “Etchmiadzin” is usually interpreted as “the Only‑Begotten descended”.
      </p>

      <h3>Rebuildings and strengthening</h3>
      <p>
        Between the 5th and 7th centuries the church was rebuilt and reinforced several times, 
        and under Catholicos Komitas I Aghvetsi it acquired the main cross‑domed form that has been preserved to this day.
      </p>

      <h3>From medieval to modern times</h3>
      <p>
        In the 17th century the bell tower and additional buildings were added, 
        and in the 19th century new educational and cultural structures turned 
        Etchmiadzin into a major spiritual and cultural center for Armenians worldwide.
      </p>

      <h3>Modern period</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2000 the cathedral and the surrounding churches have been inscribed 
        on the UNESCO World Heritage List, and it remains the seat of the Catholicos of 
        All Armenians and the main sanctuary of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
      </p>

      <h3>Did you know?</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Etchmiadzin is often described as one of the oldest functioning Christian cathedrals in the world.</li>
      <li>The cathedral houses important Christian relics and liturgical treasures.</li>
      <li>For centuries it has been a key symbol of Armenian identity, faith and statehood.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Etchmiadzin is not just a historic monument; it is a living place where faith, history and the present meet.

    <h2>Octagonal Church of Artashat</h2>

    <h3>Location and discovery</h3>
    <p>
      The remains of the octagonal church were discovered in the area of ancient Artashat (Artaxata),
      which in the Hellenistic and early Christian periods was one of the capitals of Armenia.
      The church stands on the slope of a hill and occupies an area of about 1,000 m².
    </p>

    <h3>Dating and significance</h3>
    <p>
      Radiocarbon analysis of wooden remains indicates that the church was built in the first half
      of the 4th century, making it one of the earliest archaeologically documented churches in Armenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The octagonal plan with cross-shaped extensions is typical of early Christian memorial structures,
      so researchers suggest that the building may have been erected over the tomb of a martyr or other saint.
    </p>

    <h3>Architectural features</h3>
    <p>
      The octagonal core of the church is about 30 meters in diameter. The building is made of local stone
      and mortar, with a simple floor and terracotta tiles inside. Marble cover slabs found during the
      excavations show that the interior was richly decorated with imported Mediterranean marble.
    </p>

    <h3>Trace of early Christianity</h3>
    <p>
      The octagonal church of Artashat is an important piece of evidence that Christian worship had already
      taken firm root in one of Armenia’s capitals by the early 4th century. It also illustrates the links
      between Armenia and the architectural and artistic traditions of the Eastern Mediterranean world.
