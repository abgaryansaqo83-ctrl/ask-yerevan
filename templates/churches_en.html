<h2>Etchmiadzin Mother Cathedral</h2>

<p>
Etchmiadzin Mother Cathedral is considered one of the oldest cathedrals in the world
and the spiritual heart of Armenia. It was founded in the 4th century on the site
where, according to tradition, Gregory the Illuminator saw a vision of Christ
descending.

<p>
Over the centuries the cathedral has been rebuilt and strengthened several times,
but its core still preserves very early Christian layers and today it remains
the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians.
