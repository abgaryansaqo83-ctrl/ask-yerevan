      <h2>Etchmiadzin Mother Cathedral</h2>

      <h3>Foundation (4th century)</h3>
      <p>
        The Mother Cathedral of Etchmiadzin took shape in the 4th century,
        when Armenia was among the first countries to adopt Christianity
        as a state religion. According to tradition, Saint Gregory the Illuminator
        had a vision in which Christ descended from heaven and struck the ground
        with a golden hammer, indicating the place for the cathedral.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this comes the name “Etchmiadzin”, literally meaning
        “The Only‑Begotten descended”.
      </p>

      <h3>Rebuildings and strengthening</h3>
      <p>
        Between the 5th and 7th centuries the cathedral was rebuilt and reinforced
        several times, and under Catholicos Komitas I Aghcetsi it received its
        main cross‑domed volume, which has largely been preserved to this day.
      </p>

      <h3>From Middle Ages to modern times</h3>
      <p>
        In the 17th century a belfry and other buildings were added to the complex,
        and in the 19th century educational and cultural institutions were built,
        which helped consolidate Etchmiadzin as the spiritual and cultural center
        of Armenians worldwide.
      </p>

      <h3>Recent period</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2000 the Mother Cathedral of Etchmiadzin and the nearby churches
        have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, and the cathedral
        continues to serve as the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians and
        the main shrine of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
      </p>

      <h3>Interesting facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Etchmiadzin is considered one of the oldest functioning Christian cathedrals in the world.</li>
        <li>The cathedral preserves important Christian relics and liturgical treasures.</li>
        <li>For centuries it has been a key symbol of Armenian identity, faith and statehood.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Etchmiadzin is not only a historical monument, but a living place where
        faith, history and the present meet.

      <h2>Artashat Octagonal Church</h2>

      <h3>Location and discovery</h3>
      <p>
        The remains of the octagonal church were discovered in ancient Artashat
        (Artaxata), which in the Hellenistic and early Christian periods was one
        of the capitals of Armenia. The church stood on a hillside and occupied
        an area of about 1,000 m².
      </p>

      <h3>Date and significance</h3>
      <p>
        Radiocarbon analysis of wooden fragments shows that the church was built
        in the first half of the 4th century, making it one of the earliest
        archaeologically documented churches in Armenia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The octagonal plan with cross‑shaped extensions is typical of early
        Christian memorial structures, suggesting that the site may have marked
        the grave of a martyr.
      </p>

      <h3>Architectural features</h3>
      <p>
        The octagonal core was about 30 meters in diameter. The building was made
        of local stone and lime mortar, with a simple floor and terracotta tiles
        inside. Marble slabs found during excavations indicate that the interior
        was richly decorated with imported Mediterranean marble.
      </p>

      <h3>Trace of early Christianity</h3>
      <p>
        The octagonal church of Artashat is important evidence that Christian
        worship was firmly established in one of Armenia’s capitals already
        at the beginning of the 4th century, and it shows links with architectural
        and artistic traditions of the Eastern Mediterranean.

      <h2>Saint Hripsime Church</h2>

      <h3>Location and origins</h3>
      <p>
        Saint Hripsime Church stands in Vagharshapat, close to the spiritual
        center of Etchmiadzin, on the site where, according to tradition,
        the virgin martyr Saint Hripsime was buried.
      </p>

      <h3>Construction (618 AD)</h3>
      <p>
        The present stone church was built in 618 under Catholicos Komitas I
        Aghcetsi and is considered one of the purest examples of the early
        medieval Armenian domed basilica type.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        Its cruciform domed plan, clear volumes and harmonious proportions
        of the dome had a strong influence on later Armenian church
        architecture.
      </p>

      <h3>Heritage</h3>
      <p>
        Saint Hripsime Church is part of the UNESCO World Heritage site
        “Cathedral and Churches of Etchmiadzin and the Archaeological Site
        of Zvartnots”, together with the Mother Cathedral and other
        historic churches.
