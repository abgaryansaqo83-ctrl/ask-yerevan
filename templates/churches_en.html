        Etchmiadzin Mother Cathedral is considered one of the oldest cathedrals in the world
        and the spiritual heart of Armenia. It was founded in the 4th century on the site
        where, according to tradition, Gregory the Illuminator saw a vision of Christ
        descending.

        Over the centuries the cathedral has been rebuilt and strengthened several times,
        but its core still preserves very early Christian layers and today it remains
        the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians.
