      <h3>Foundation (4th century)</h3>
      <p>
        Holy Etchmiadzin Cathedral took shape in the 4th century, when Armenia was one of the first countries
        to adopt Christianity as a state religion.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to tradition, Saint Gregory the Illuminator had a vision in which Christ descended from heaven
        and struck the ground with a golden hammer, showing the place where the cathedral should be built.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name “Etchmiadzin” literally means “the Only‑Begotten descended”.
      </p>

      <h3>Rebuilding and strengthening</h3>
      <p>
        Between the 5th and 7th centuries the cathedral was rebuilt and reinforced several times, and under
        Catholicos Komitas A Aghtsetsi it received the cruciform domed layout that has survived to this day.
      </p>

      <h3>From the Middle Ages to the modern era</h3>
      <p>
        In the 17th century a belfry and other monastic buildings were added, and in the 19th century new
        educational and cultural institutions were built around the complex, turning Etchmiadzin into a major
        spiritual and cultural center for Armenians.
      </p>

      <h3>Recent period</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2000, Holy Etchmiadzin Cathedral and the nearby churches have been inscribed on the UNESCO
        World Heritage List, and the cathedral remains the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians and the
        main shrine of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
      </p>

      <h3>Did you know?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Etchmiadzin is considered one of the oldest cathedrals in continuous use in the Christian world.</li>
        <li>The cathedral treasures a number of important Christian relics and liturgical objects.</li>
        <li>For centuries it has been a key symbol of Armenian identity, faith and statehood.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Etchmiadzin is not just an ancient monument, but a living place where faith, history and the present meet.

        <span class="church-address">📍 Artashat, Ararat Province</span>
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/m1pKJj4JmvFgJyuw5" class="church-map-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">🗺️ Open in Maps</a>
      </div>
      <h3>Location and discovery</h3>
      <p>
        The remains of the octagonal church were discovered at ancient Artashat–Artaxata, which served as
        one of Armenia’s capitals in the Hellenistic and early Christian periods.
        The church stood on a hillside and occupied about 1000 square meters.
      </p>

      <h3>Dating and significance</h3>
      <p>
        Radiocarbon analysis of wooden fragments shows that the church was built in the first half of the
        4th century, making it one of the earliest archaeologically documented churches in Armenia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The octagonal plan with cross‑shaped extensions is typical of early Christian memorial or martyr churches,
        so it is assumed that the building may have marked the grave of a martyr.
      </p>

      <h3>Architectural features</h3>
      <p>
        The octagonal core has a diameter of about 30 meters and was built of local stone and lime mortar,
        with a simple floor and terracotta tiles inside.
      </p>

      <h3>Trace of early Christianity in Armenia</h3>
      <p>
        The octagonal church of Artashat is an important proof that Christian worship was firmly established
        here already in the early 4th century and shows architectural links between Armenia and the eastern
        Mediterranean world.

      <h3>Location and foundation</h3>
      <p>
        Saint Hripsime Church stands in Vagharshapat near the spiritual center of Etchmiadzin, on the site where,
        according to tradition, the martyr virgin Hripsime is buried.
      </p>

      <h3>Construction (618)</h3>
      <p>
        The present stone church was built in 618 under Catholicos Komitas A Aghtsetsi and is one of the
        classic examples of early medieval Armenian domed centralized churches.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        Its cruciform domed plan and clear volumes strongly influenced later Armenian church architecture.
      </p>

      <h3>Heritage</h3>
      <p>
        Saint Hripsime is part of the UNESCO World Heritage listing “Cathedral and Churches of Etchmiadzin and

      <h3>Location and martyrdom</h3>
      <p>
        Saint Gayane stands in Vagharshapat just south of Holy Etchmiadzin, on the site where, according to
        tradition, Abbess Gayane was martyred together with Hripsime and the other virgins.
      </p>

      <h3>Construction (630)</h3>
      <p>
        The present church was built in 630 under Catholicos Ezra on the site of a smaller memorial chapel
        and has largely preserved its original form.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        It is a three‑aisled domed basilica with four interior pillars and is considered one of the best
        7th‑century examples of this type.

      <h3>Early Christian tradition and a 17th‑century church</h3>

      <p>
        Khor Virap is located near ancient Artashat, at the foot of Mount Ararat, and is associated with the
        famous story of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, who, according to tradition, was imprisoned here in a
        deep pit for about thirteen years before King Tiridates III converted and Armenia became the first
        officially Christian state.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sources mention a small Christian church here as early as the 4th–5th centuries, and in the 7th century
        a small chapel of Saint George was built on the site.
      </p>

      <p>
        The present monastery complex was formed in the 17th century with the construction of the Surb Astvatsatsin
        Church, monastic cells and walls; today Khor Virap is one of Armenia’s most visited pilgrimage sites,
        famous for its classic view of Ararat.

      </div>
      <h3>Foundation and from island to peninsula</h3>

      <p>
        Sevanavank stands on a rocky height on the northwestern shore of Lake Sevan which, until the mid‑20th
        century, was a real island separated from the mainland by deep water.
        According to an inscription, the monastery was founded by Princess Mariam, daughter of King Ashot of
        the Bagratuni dynasty, who built the churches of the Holy Apostles and the Holy Mother of God.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tradition holds that an earlier Christian chapel was built here already in the 4th century at the
        initiative of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, and in the 9th century the monastery became a fortress and
        learning center of the Syunik princes, with its own school and scriptorium.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Soviet period the water level of Lake Sevan was lowered and the island turned into a peninsula;
        today a short stairway leads up to the monastery with wide views over the lake. Sevanavank was restored
        mainly in the mid‑20th century and again became an active spiritual center in the 1990s.

      <h3>A rock‑carved monastery and the legend of the Holy Lance</h3>

      <p>
        Geghard Monastery lies deep in the Upper Azat Valley, pressed against
        steep cliffs so that much of the complex seems to grow out of the rock
        itself. Its name comes from the “Holy Geghard”, the lance that, according
        to tradition, pierced Christ’s side and was once kept here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the walls you find both free‑standing churches and fully
        rock‑cut chapels whose domes and vaults are carved directly into the
        mountain. In one of the cave halls, if you look up you see a round
        opening in the ceiling where a beam of light falls into the dark space
        like a spotlight.
      </p>

      <h3>History and dating</h3>
      <p>
        The earliest foundations at Geghard go back at least to the 4th century,
        while the main church of the Holy Mother of God dates from the 13th
        century, built under the Zakarian princes. At that time the site became
        a fortified monastery with walls, gates and inner courtyards.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and cave chambers</h3>
      <p>
        Geghard combines several worlds in one place: classical Armenian
        cross‑domed architecture, deep cave chapels with carved columns and
        walls covered in khachkars and inscriptions, and an open courtyard
        that suddenly reveals the dramatic canyon of the Azat River.
      </p>

      <h3>UNESCO site today</h3>
      <p>
        Geghard Monastery and the Upper Azat Valley are inscribed on the UNESCO
        World Heritage List as a unique blend of landscape and spiritual heritage.
        The monastery is still active, and the views from the surrounding slopes
        over the cliffs and the valley make it one of the most impressive stops
        in Armenia.

      </div>
      <h3>A monastery hidden in a red-rock gorge</h3>

      <p>
        Noravank is tucked deep inside the Amaghu Gorge, hemmed in by steep
        red cliffs so that the monastery seems to be growing out of the rock
        itself. As you drive into the gorge the road narrows,
        and at the very end a small plateau opens up with the monastery complex.
      </p>

      <p>
        The core of the complex dates from the 13th century, when the churches
        of Surb Karapet and the small two-storey Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother
        of God) were built, along with chapels and halls linked to the Orbelian
        princely family.
      </p>

      <h3>Orbelian tombs and the two-storey church</h3>
      <p>
        The compact Surb Astvatsatsin church, with a burial chamber on the
        lower level and a small sanctuary above, is one of Noravank’s most
        iconic buildings. The narrow external stairway leading to the upper
        floor is a favourite photo spot and a good example of how medieval
        Armenian architects played with form and symbolism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tombstones of the Orbelian princes, khachkars and long inscriptions on
        the walls show how Noravank functioned not only as a spiritual center
        but also as a regional political hub in southern Armenia.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and landscape</h3>
      <p>
        Almost completely surrounded by cliffs, Noravank changes character with
        the light: in the early morning it feels cool and quiet, while at sunset
        the red rocks glow and the whole complex turns golden.
      </p>

      <h3>Noravank today</h3>
      <p>
        Today Noravank is one of Armenia’s most visited monasteries; it is often
        combined with Garni and Geghard or with trips further south toward Syunik,
        making it a perfect stop between Yerevan and the southern regions.

      <h3>A cliff-edge monastery above the Vorotan Gorge</h3>

      <p>
        Tatev Monastery sits dramatically on the edge of the deep Vorotan Gorge,
        on a rocky plateau from which the cliffs drop almost vertically down
        into the valley. From above, the complex looks like a
        compact fortress guarding the surrounding landscape.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main core of the monastery was formed in the 9th–10th centuries and
        includes the church of Saints Paul and Peter, the church of Saint Gregory,
        chapels, monastic cells and courtyards, all enclosed by defensive walls.
      </p>

      <h3>Medieval university and center of learning</h3>
      <p>
        In the 14th–15th centuries Tatev was famous for its university, one of the
        most important centers of scholarship and manuscript production in medieval
        Armenia. Scholars taught theology, philosophy, arts and
        sciences here, and many illuminated manuscripts were created in its scriptorium.
      </p>

      <p>
        Walking around the complex today, you can still sense this academic past in
        the remains of the library, classrooms and residential cells around the
        main courtyard.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and the “swinging column”</h3>
      <p>
        Tatev is also known for its so‑called swinging or rocking column, a stone
        pillar that is sensitive to small movements and is thought to have served
        as an early warning device or simply as an ingenious architectural feature.
      </p>

      <h3>Wings of Tatev ropeway</h3>
      <p>
        Today many visitors reach Tatev via the “Wings of Tatev” aerial tramway,
        one of the world’s longest reversible cableways, which connects the village
        of Halidzor with the monastery across the gorge.
        The 12‑minute ride offers sweeping views of the cliffs and brings the
        monastery slowly closer from above.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, the medieval monastery, the dramatic gorge and the modern ropeway
        make Tatev one of the absolute highlights of southern Armenia.

      <h3>A Bagratid-era center of learning above the Debed Gorge</h3>

      <p>
        Haghpat Monastery stands on a plateau above the Debed Gorge in northern
        Armenia, surrounded by green hills and deep valleys.
        It was founded in the 10th century under the Bagratid kings and soon
        became one of medieval Armenia’s key spiritual and educational centers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main church, Surb Nshan (Holy Sign), was built between 976 and 991
        on the order of Queen Khosrovanush, and in later centuries a large
        gavit, belfry, scriptorium and other monastic buildings were added
        around it.
      </p>

      <h3>Gavit, scriptorium and khachkars</h3>
      <p>
        Haghpat is famous for its spacious gavit, which served both as a
        gathering place and as a space for teaching; the monastery’s scriptorium
        was an important center for copying and illuminating manuscripts.
        Numerous khachkars and long inscriptions record the names of benefactors
        and monks over the centuries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moving through the passages and small courtyards, you feel that this was
        once an entire monastic “village” with living quarters, workrooms and
        study spaces, not just a single church.
      </p>

      <h3>UNESCO together with Sanahin</h3>
      <p>
        Haghpat and nearby Sanahin Monastery together form a single UNESCO World
        Heritage Site as outstanding examples of Bagratid-period Armenian
        architecture. The two complexes stand on opposite
        sides of the Debed Gorge and are usually visited on the same trip.
      </p>

      <h3>Haghpat today</h3>
      <p>
        Today Haghpat remains a functioning monastery, but it also feels like a
        quiet rural place with grass-covered roofs, stone paths and often a
        slightly misty sky. It captures the atmosphere of the
        Lori region in a very concentrated way.

      <h3>A medieval learning center hidden in the mountains of Lori</h3>

      <p>
        Sanahin Monastery stands on a high plateau above the Debed Gorge in
        northern Armenia, very close to Haghpat, and together they form a
        single UNESCO World Heritage Site.
        Founded in the 10th century, Sanahin became one of the key spiritual
        and educational centers of Bagratid Armenia.
      </p>

      <p>
        At its core are the churches of the Holy Mother of God and the
        All-Saviour, around which gavits, chapels, a scriptorium, monastic
        cells and a belfry were added over the centuries.
      </p>

      <h3>Place of learning and manuscripts</h3>
      <p>
        In the Middle Ages Sanahin was home to a school and scriptorium where
        scholars worked on theology, philosophy and the sciences, and where
        many finely illuminated manuscripts were produced.
        The remains of study rooms and library spaces still hint at this
        intellectual life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Walking through the courtyards you notice numerous khachkars, stone
        benches and old trees that contribute to the feeling of a living,
        open-air museum.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and atmosphere</h3>
      <p>
        Built mostly of dark basalt, the churches of Sanahin have strong, austere
        volumes that sit perfectly in the often misty, overcast landscape of
        the Lori highlands.
        Inside, the spaces are dim and the light enters through small windows
        and oculi in the domes, creating a very contemplative mood.
      </p>

      <h3>Part of a UNESCO pair</h3>
      <p>
        Together with nearby Haghpat, Sanahin is inscribed on the UNESCO World
        Heritage List as an outstanding example of medieval Armenian monastic
        architecture.
        Most visitors see both monasteries in a single trip, gaining a good
        sense of the monastic culture of the Debed Canyon.

      </div>
      <h3>A forest monastery in the hills of Dilijan</h3>

      <p>
        Haghartsin Monastery lies deep in the forests of Dilijan National Park,
        in a small valley where the surrounding slopes are densely covered with
        trees.
        Most of the complex was built in the 12th–13th centuries and is linked
        to local princes and important clerics of the Tavush region.
      </p>

      <p>
        The complex includes several churches—Surb Grigor, Surb Stepanos and
        Surb Astvatsatsin—together with a gavit, refectory, monks’ cells and
        service buildings that form a small monastic “village” in the woods.
      </p>

      <h3>Pilgrimage site and place to relax</h3>

      <p>
        Today Haghartsin is both a place of worship and one of the most popular
        stops around Dilijan; in the courtyard you will often see pilgrims and
        travelers resting under the trees or wandering among the khachkars.
      </p>

      <p>
        The combination of dense forest, cool air and dark stone buildings gives
        Haghartsin a very tranquil, almost secluded atmosphere, quite different
        from the open landscapes of the Ararat plain.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and restoration</h3>
      <p>
        The churches follow the classical Armenian cross‑domed type but with
        relatively simple exteriors that focus attention on the stone, the
        proportions and the surrounding nature rather than on heavy decoration.
        In recent decades Haghartsin has undergone significant restoration and
        is now much easier to access than it used to be.

      </div>
      <h3>Mkhitar Gosh’s monastery and a cradle of medieval law</h3>

      <p>
        Goshavank stands above the village of Gosh in Tavush province, in a
        forested area east of Dilijan.
        It was built in the 12th–13th centuries on the site of the older Getik
        Monastery, which had been destroyed by an earthquake.
      </p>

      <p>
        The complex is closely associated with Mkhitar Gosh, the medieval
        scholar and jurist whose famous Lawcode was compiled here, making
        Goshavank an important center of Armenian legal and theological thought.
        A statue of Mkhitar Gosh stands in the monastery courtyard.
      </p>

      <h3>Churches, gavit and khachkars</h3>
      <p>
        The main buildings include the large Surb Astvatsatsin church, the
        smaller Surb Grigor church, a gavit, former school buildings and
        various service and residential structures.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of Armenia’s most famous khachkars, known for its incredibly fine
        carving, stands at Goshavank and is often cited as a masterpiece of
        Armenian stonework.
      </p>

      <h3>Gosh Lake and the landscape</h3>
      <p>
        Many visitors combine Goshavank with a short hike to nearby Gosh Lake,
        using forest paths that link the monastery and the lake.
        This makes Goshavank both a cultural and a nature stop on trips around
        Dilijan and Tavush.

      <h3>Red tuff monastery on the Akhurian shore</h3>

      <p>
        The medieval monastic complex of Marmashen is located just outside Marmashen village,
        on the edge of the Akhurian River gorge, about ten kilometers northwest of Gyumri.
        The monastery was primarily built in the 10th-11th centuries and is associated with
        the name of Prince Vahram Pahlavuni.
      </p>

      <p>
        The heart of the complex is the Katholike church, beside which stand several more
        churches and the ruins of a gavit, all made of reddish tuff, with characteristic
        arcades and blind niches of the "Ani school."
      </p>

      <h3>Unexpected plateau above the river</h3>

      <p>
        Marmashen stands on a plateau slightly elevated above the river level, so the churches
        seem to gaze toward the windings of the Akhurian. The area is not enclosed or silent,
        but somewhat isolated from the main road, and the monastery opens up to your eyes
        almost suddenly when you emerge above the gorge.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spring and summer, the monastery is surrounded by greenery and fruit trees,
        which softens the appearance of the red tuff and stone facades even more.
      </p>

      <h3>Medieval atmosphere of tranquility</h3>

      <p>
        Marmashen was not only a spiritual center but also a mausoleum for the princely
        dynasty, and beneath the floor of the gavit, the tomb of Vahram Pahlavuni is
        still commemorated today.
      </p>

      <p>
        During a visit here, you often hear only the sound of the river, the wind, and
        occasionally the voices of a small group of visitors, so the monastery is very
        suitable for a peaceful walk or sitting and being silent.

      <h3>A drop of light on the edge of Vagharshapat</h3>

      <p>
        Saint Shoghakat Church stands in Vagharshapat, forming part of the wider
        spiritual landscape together with the Mother Cathedral, Saint Hripsime
        and Saint Gayane.
        Built of reddish and dark tuff on the open plain, it is easy to spot
        from afar thanks to its compact but powerful domed silhouette.
      </p>

      <p>
        The name “Shoghakat” can be understood as “a ray that has dropped” or
        “a drop of light” and is linked to the tradition that a beam of light
        once descended here upon a group of Christian virgins martyred for
        their faith.
      </p>

      <h3>Tradition and place of remembrance</h3>
      <p>
        According to this tradition, the church marks the place connected with
        the martyrdom of these virgins, whose story is closely tied to that of
        Hripsime and Gayane.
        The idea of a heavenly light falling on them gave the site its name and
        turned it into a place of pilgrimage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, the dim space and narrow beams of light entering through small
        windows reinforce this story and create a quiet, reflective atmosphere
        for visitors.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and setting</h3>
      <p>
        Shoghakat is a relatively small, cross‑domed church with a simple gavit‑like
        entrance and very restrained exterior decoration.
        The focus is on the overall mass, the dome and the church’s position in
        the open landscape rather than on elaborate carvings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together with the cathedral and other historic churches of Etchmiadzin,
        Saint Shoghakat is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is often
        included in the same day’s visit as the Mother See, Saint Hripsime and
        Saint Gayane.

      <h3>A monumental basilica on the plain</h3>

      <p>
        Aruchavank stands near the village of Aruch in Aragatsotn province, on
        a wide plain where its massive basilica silhouette dominates the
        horizon.
        The church, dedicated to Saint Gregory, is one of the finest examples
        of large Armenian basilicas.
      </p>

      <p>
        The site is associated with the Mamikonian princely family, who chose
        Aruch as one of their main residences and turned it into both a
        political and spiritual center.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and interior space</h3>

      <p>
        Aruchavank is a long, barrel‑vaulted basilica with a wide central nave,
        high arches and powerful stone walls that create a deep, echoing
        interior.
        Inside you can still see traces of the collapsed dome, heavy piers and
        older construction layers in the masonry.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sheer size of the building and its isolated position on the plain
        give it the feel of a stone fortress rising out of the landscape.
      </p>

      <h3>Partly ruined, still alive</h3>
      <p>
        Although parts of the cathedral are ruined, Aruchavank is still used
        occasionally for services and remains open as a historic monument for
        visitors.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wind across the plain, the grey stone of the walls and the distant
        view toward Mount Aragats together create a very minimalist but powerful
        atmosphere around the church.

      <h3>A clifftop monastery above the Kasagh Gorge</h3>

      <p>
        Saghmosavank stands on a dramatic clifftop in Aragatsotn province,
        right on the edge of the deep Kasagh River Gorge.
        On clear days the courtyard opens onto a panorama of the gorge below
        and Mount Aragats in the distance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The monastery took shape in the medieval period under local princes
        and church leaders, who built the main church, gavit and a scriptorium
        here.
      </p>

      <h3>Church, gavit and scriptorium</h3>
      <p>
        At the heart of the complex is the church of Surb Sion, a cross‑domed
        building with an attached gavit, and a separate scriptorium where
        manuscripts were once copied and stored.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around them are khachkars, a stone‑paved courtyard and smaller
        structures that together give the impression of a small monastic
        village hanging above the canyon.
      </p>

      <h3>Atmosphere of the gorge</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most striking experiences at Saghmosavank is simply
        walking to the edge of the cliff and looking straight down into
        the Kasagh Gorge, where the river disappears between rock walls.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many visitors combine Saghmosavank with nearby Hovhannavank, either
        by road or via a hiking trail along the gorge, which makes for a
        full day of landscapes and monasteries in the same area.

      <h3>A monastery between village and gorge</h3>

      <p>
        Hovhannavank is a medieval monastic complex in the village of Ohanavan,
        set right on the edge of the deep Kasagh River Gorge.
        It is dedicated to John the Baptist (Surb Karapet), and the mix of older
        and later buildings is clearly visible in its architecture.
      </p>

      <p>
        The oldest layer is the single‑nave basilica, traditionally linked to
        Gregory the Illuminator, while next to it stands the 13th‑century main
        church and the large gavit.
      </p>

      <h3>Surb Karapet and the gavit</h3>
      <p>
        The main church of Surb Karapet (Katoghike) is a cross‑domed structure
        sponsored by Prince Vache Vachutyan, notable for its rich stone carving
        and commanding position above the gorge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Attached to it, the gavit is a spacious four‑pier hall with a central
        rotunda that lets in light from above and gives the interior a slightly
        theatrical feel, like an inner courtyard brought indoors.
      </p>

      <h3>Edge‑of‑the‑gorge atmosphere</h3>
      <p>
        The view from Hovhannavank is more enclosed than at Saghmosavank: the
        walls, enclosure and village houses press close around the complex,
        so the drop into the gorge feels sudden and dramatic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many visitors start or end the hiking trail from Saghmosavank here, as
        the two monasteries face each other across the Kasagh Gorge and together
        create a full day of both history and landscapes.

      </div>
      <h3>A village basilica and a cliffside monastery</h3>

      <p>
        The domed basilica of Odzun stands on a wide plateau above the Debed
        Canyon and is one of Armenia’s important early Christian basilicas.
        Built between the 5th and 7th centuries, it is distinguished by its
        external arcaded galleries and long, clean lines that are especially
        striking from the south and west.
      </p>

      <p>
        The church is surrounded by a spacious green courtyard with khachkars
        and ancient funerary monuments, and it still serves as an active place
        of worship for the surrounding villages.
      </p>

      <h3>Courtyard and canyon views</h3>
      <p>
        From the edge of the plateau, the land drops abruptly into the Debed
        Canyon, creating a powerful contrast between the calm village setting
        above and the rugged gorge below.
      </p>

      <p>
        From here a footpath descends towards Horomayr Monastery, turning a
        church visit into a short hike along the canyon slope.
      </p>

      <h3>Upper and lower Horomayr</h3>
      <p>
        Horomayr is a medieval monastic complex split into two parts: an upper
        section reachable from Odzun, and a lower section built directly into
        the cliffs just above the river.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its chapels, rock‑hewn rooms and carved khachkars give the impression
        that the monastery has grown out of the rock and is now hanging on the
        canyon wall.
      </p>

      <h3>Hiking in the Debed Canyon</h3>
      <p>
        One of the region’s classic hikes is the Kobayr–Horomayr–Odzun trail,
        an 8–11 km route along the left side of the canyon with constant
        viewpoints over the river and cliffs.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a shorter option, the 1.5 km descent from Odzun to Horomayr is
        enough to feel both the depth of the Debed and the dramatic position
        of the monastery on the cliff.

      <h3>A solitary monastery deep in a canyon</h3>

      <p>
        Gndevank is a 10th‑century monastery in Vayots Dzor, tucked into the
        depths of the Arpa River Gorge, away from the main road.
        Tradition links its foundation to Princess Sophia, and the complex
        retains the feel of a compact fortified retreat.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main church rises from a small walled courtyard, with the canyon
        walls and slopes pressing in close on all sides, making the monastery
        feel self‑contained and protected by the surrounding landscape.
      </p>

      <h3>Atmosphere of the Arpa Gorge</h3>
      <p>
        Down here the river is close, the cliffs tower above, and the monastery
        seems to hold on to a ledge between rock and water.
      </p>

      <p>
        Old tracks and footpaths around the gorge let visitors turn a simple
        visit into a short hike, seeing Gndevank from different levels on the
        canyon walls.
      </p>

      <h3>A hidden yet reachable place</h3>
      <p>
        Gndevank is often described as a “hidden monastery at the end of a
        gorge hike”, but in practice it is still quite reachable from the
        Jermuk and Yeghegnadzor side roads.
      </p>

      <p>
        For anyone looking for a quieter, more secluded monastic atmosphere,
        away from big crossroads and tour buses, Gndevank gives that feeling
        almost immediately as you descend towards the river and stone walls.

      <h3>A modern symbol for 1700 years of Christianity</h3>

      <p>
        Rising on a small hill in Yerevan, Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral is the largest Armenian
        Apostolic church in the world and the spiritual “new heart” of the capital. It was built between
        1997 and 2001 and consecrated in 2001 on the occasion of the 1700th anniversary of Christianity
        as Armenia’s state religion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The complex includes the main cathedral with around 1700 seats and two smaller chapels dedicated to
        King Tiridates III and Queen Ashkhen. Relics of Saint Gregory the Illuminator were brought here from
        Naples and placed in a special reliquary, and shortly after the consecration the cathedral was visited
        by Pope John Paul II.
      </p>

      <p>
        Architecturally, the building combines traditional Armenian forms with clean, modern lines, creating
        a wide, light‑filled interior that feels both monumental and calm. Standing in the open courtyard
        under the 54‑meter bell tower, you see the whole of Yerevan spread out below and, on clear days,
        Mount Ararat on the horizon.

      </div>
      <h3>A quiet courtyard in the heart of Yerevan</h3>

      <p>
        Saint Anna Church sits right in the center of Yerevan on Abovyan Street, yet as soon as you pass
        through the gate the city noise stays outside and a calm stone courtyard opens up. The church was
        built between 2011 and 2014 and consecrated in 2015 as part of a single complex together with the
        tiny 13th‑century Katoghike Church just a few meters away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its architecture combines a classic Armenian cruciform plan and dome with clean contemporary lines
        and warm pink tuff stone, so it feels both traditional and perfectly at home in today’s city. On one
        side of the courtyard rises the Catholicosate residence, which adds a sense of importance, but the
        atmosphere remains intimate and welcoming.
      </p>

      <p>
        Saint Anna is especially atmospheric at dusk, when the facades and the passages around Katoghike are
        softly lit and the city’s noise turns into a distant background. It is the kind of place where you may
        enter “just to have a look” and end up sitting on a bench for half an hour, watching people pass through
        the courtyard and feeling old and new Yerevan merge in one frame.

    <h3>Contemporary cathedral consecrated in 2015 – heart of Masyatsotni Diocese</h3>

    <p>
      Saint Thaddeus Church is located in the center of Masis city and has served 
      as the diocesan cathedral of Masyatsotni since 2021. The construction site 
      was chosen by Vazgen I, Catholicos of All Armenians, in 1991, and the ground 
      blessing ceremony was conducted the same year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Construction began in 2003 through the initiative and funding of benefactor 
      Hrant Vardanyan, and in 2015 the church was completed by his sons, Mikayel 
      and Karen Vardanyan. On October 4, 2015, the church was consecrated by 
      Karekin II, Catholicos of All Armenians.
    </p>

    <h3>Architecture rich with symbolism</h3>

    <p>
      The church was designed by architects Arthur and Anahit Tarkhanyan, 
      combining traditional Armenian church-building practices with contemporary 
      construction solutions. The cathedral has three levels and is distinguished 
      by its unique composition and spatial solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The interior space is formed by two intersecting squares, symbolizing 
      eternity and purity of faith. The dome rests on semi-crossing arches, 
      and the facing has a unique color scheme – colors become lighter from 
      center to edges, and darker from foundation to dome.
    </p>

    <h3>33 meters – symbolic height</h3>

    <p>
      The cathedral's height, excluding the dome's cross, is 33 meters, 
      symbolizing the years of Jesus Christ's earthly life. Along the entire 
      length of the wall surrounding the church, 33 biblical commandments 
      are engraved, creating a unique unity of spiritual and architectural 
      symbolism.
    </p>

    <h3>Memorial sites and candle lighting</h3>

    <p>
      Near the church entrance is the candle lighting hall, where 12 sacred 
      images were installed in 2025. In the church courtyard stands a memorial 
      fountain dedicated to Hrant Vardanyan's memory, and on April 24, 2016, 
      a khachkar was placed honoring the 1.5 million martyrs of the Armenian 
      Genocide. The khachkar is carved from a single piece of tuff stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Saint Thaddeus Church today is not only the spiritual center of Masis 
      city but of the entire Masyatsotni Diocese, where liturgies, events, 
      and pilgrimages are held – especially on the feast day of Saints 
      Thaddeus and Bartholomew the Apostles.
