      <h2>Etchmiadzin Mother Cathedral</h2>

      <h3>Foundation (4th century)</h3>
      <p>
        Etchmiadzin Mother Cathedral took shape in the 4th century, when Armenia became one of the first states to adopt Christianity as a state religion.
        According to tradition, Saint Gregory the Illuminator saw a vision of Christ descending from heaven and striking the ground with a golden hammer, marking the place where the cathedral should be built.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name “Etchmiadzin” is usually interpreted as “the Only‑Begotten descended”.
      </p>

      <h3>Rebuildings and strengthening</h3>
      <p>
        Between the 5th and 7th centuries the church was rebuilt and reinforced several times, and under Catholicos Komitas I Aghvetsi it acquired the main cross‑domed form that has been preserved to this day.
      </p>

      <h3>From medieval to modern times</h3>
      <p>
        In the 17th century the bell tower and additional buildings were added, and in the 19th century new educational and cultural structures turned Etchmiadzin into a major spiritual and cultural center for Armenians worldwide.
      </p>

      <h3>Modern period</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2000 the cathedral and the surrounding churches have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, and it remains the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians and the main sanctuary of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
      </p>
