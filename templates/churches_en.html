      <h2>Etchmiadzin Mother Cathedral</h2>

      <h3>Foundation (4th century)</h3>
      <p>
        The Mother Cathedral of Etchmiadzin took shape in the 4th century,
        when Armenia was among the first countries to adopt Christianity
        as a state religion. According to tradition, Saint Gregory the Illuminator
        had a vision in which Christ descended from heaven and struck the ground
        with a golden hammer, indicating the place for the cathedral.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this comes the name “Etchmiadzin”, literally meaning
        “The Only‑Begotten descended”.
      </p>

      <h3>Rebuildings and strengthening</h3>
      <p>
        Between the 5th and 7th centuries the cathedral was rebuilt and reinforced
        several times, and under Catholicos Komitas I Aghcetsi it received its
        main cross‑domed volume, which has largely been preserved to this day.
      </p>

      <h3>From Middle Ages to modern times</h3>
      <p>
        In the 17th century a belfry and other buildings were added to the complex,
        and in the 19th century educational and cultural institutions were built,
        which helped consolidate Etchmiadzin as the spiritual and cultural center
        of Armenians worldwide.
      </p>

      <h3>Recent period</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2000 the Mother Cathedral of Etchmiadzin and the nearby churches
        have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, and the cathedral
        continues to serve as the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians and
        the main shrine of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
      </p>

      <h3>Interesting facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Etchmiadzin is considered one of the oldest functioning Christian cathedrals in the world.</li>
        <li>The cathedral preserves important Christian relics and liturgical treasures.</li>
        <li>For centuries it has been a key symbol of Armenian identity, faith and statehood.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Etchmiadzin is not only a historical monument, but a living place where
        faith, history and the present meet.

    <div class="church-text">
      <h2>Artashat Octagonal Church</h2>

      <h3>Location and discovery</h3>
      <p>
        The remains of the octagonal church were discovered in ancient Artashat
        (Artaxata), which in the Hellenistic and early Christian periods was one
        of the capitals of Armenia. The church stood on a hillside and occupied
        an area of about 1,000 m².
      </p>

      <h3>Date and significance</h3>
      <p>
        Radiocarbon analysis of wooden fragments shows that the church was built
        in the first half of the 4th century, making it one of the earliest
        archaeologically documented churches in Armenia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The octagonal plan with cross‑shaped extensions is typical of early
        Christian memorial structures, suggesting that the site may have marked
        the grave of a martyr.
      </p>

      <h3>Architectural features</h3>
      <p>
        The octagonal core was about 30 meters in diameter. The building was made
        of local stone and lime mortar, with a simple floor and terracotta tiles
        inside. Marble slabs found during excavations indicate that the interior
        was richly decorated with imported Mediterranean marble.
      </p>

      <h3>Trace of early Christianity</h3>
      <p>
        The octagonal church of Artashat is important evidence that Christian
        worship was firmly established in one of Armenia’s capitals already
        at the beginning of the 4th century, and it shows links with architectural
        and artistic traditions of the Eastern Mediterranean.

      <h2>Saint Hripsime Church</h2>

      <h3>Location and origins</h3>
      <p>
        Saint Hripsime Church stands in Vagharshapat, close to the spiritual
        center of Etchmiadzin, on the site where, according to tradition,
        the virgin martyr Saint Hripsime was buried.
      </p>

      <h3>Construction (618 AD)</h3>
      <p>
        The present stone church was built in 618 under Catholicos Komitas I
        Aghcetsi and is considered one of the purest examples of the early
        medieval Armenian domed basilica type.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        Its cruciform domed plan, clear volumes and harmonious proportions
        of the dome had a strong influence on later Armenian church
        architecture.
      </p>

      <h3>Heritage</h3>
      <p>
        Saint Hripsime Church is part of the UNESCO World Heritage site
        “Cathedral and Churches of Etchmiadzin and the Archaeological Site
        of Zvartnots”, together with the Mother Cathedral and other
        historic churches.

    <h3>Location and martyrdom</h3>
    <p>
      Saint Gayane Church stands in Vagharshapat, just south of the
      Mother Cathedral of Etchmiadzin, on the site where, according
      to tradition, the abbess Gayane was martyred together with
      Saint Hripsime and the other virgins.
    </p>

    <h3>Construction (630 AD)</h3>
    <p>
      The present church was built in 630 under Catholicos Ezra, on
      the site of a smaller earlier martyrium, and has preserved its
      original 7th‑century appearance almost intact.
    </p>

    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      Saint Gayane is a three‑nave domed basilica with four interior
      piers; its balanced proportions make it one of the finest
      examples of 7th‑century Armenian domed basilicas.
    </p>

    <h3>Heritage</h3>
    <p>
      The church forms part of the UNESCO World Heritage site
      “Cathedral and Churches of Etchmiadzin and the Archaeological
      Site of Zvartnots” and today functions as an active convent.

      <h2>Khor Virap Monastery</h2>
      <h3>4th–7th century tradition and a 17th‑century church</h3>

      <p>
        Khor Virap is located near ancient Artashat, at the foot of Mount Ararat,
        and is linked to the most famous legend about Saint Gregory the Illuminator:
        according to tradition he was kept here for about 13 years in a deep pit
        (“khor virap”) until King Tiridates III was miraculously healed and, in 301 AD,
        Armenia became the first officially Christian country.
      </p>

      <p>
        Already in the 4th–5th centuries sources mention that a small Christian
        church was built on the site of a former pagan temple, and in 642, during
        the time of Catholicos Nerses III the Builder, a small chapel of Saint
        George was erected here. In the following centuries the complex was
        repeatedly rebuilt.
      </p>

      <p>
        The present‑day monastic ensemble took shape in the 17th century, when the
        Church of the Holy Mother of God, monastic cells and defensive walls were
        constructed. Today Khor Virap is one of the most famous and most visited
        pilgrimage sites in Armenia, offering the classic view of Mount Ararat.

      <h2>Sevanavank Monastery</h2>
      <h3>Founded in 874, on an island that became a peninsula</h3>

      <p>
        Sevanavank stands on a rocky hill on the northern shore of Lake Sevan,
        which until the mid-20th century was a true island, separated from the
        mainland by about 3 km of deep water. Monks here literally lived “on
        the lake”. According to an inscription, the monastery was founded in
        874 by Princess Mariam, daughter of King Ashot Bagratuni, who built
        the churches of Holy Apostles and Holy Mother of God.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tradition says that Sevanavank rises on the site of a former pagan
        temple. In the 4th century, Saint Gregory the Illuminator initiated
        the construction of the first Christian chapel here, and by the 9th
        century the monastery had become both a fortress of the Syunik princes
        and an educational center with a school and scriptorium where Armenian
        manuscripts were copied and illuminated.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the Soviet era, Lake Sevan’s water level was lowered by about
        20 meters, turning the island into a peninsula that visitors can now
        reach by climbing a short staircase to the hilltop. The monastery was
        largely restored in the 1950s, and since the 1990s a spiritual
        seminary has been active here again. Today Sevanavank is not only a
        historic shrine, but also a place where lake, mountains and wind meet
        in a single panoramic window — visit at early morning silence, and it
        is hard to forget the view.

      <h2>Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral</h2>
      <h3>Modern landmark for 1700 years of Christianity</h3>

      <p>
        Rising above Yerevan on a small hill, Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral 
        is the largest Armenian Apostolic church in the world and the spiritual “new heart”
        of the capital. Built between 1997 and 2001, it was consecrated on September 23, 
        2001, to mark the 1700th anniversary of Armenia’s adoption of Christianity 
        as a state religion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The complex actually unites three churches: the main cathedral with 
        around 1700 seats, and two chapels dedicated to King Tiridates III 
        and Queen Ashkhen, the royal figures who helped Saint Gregory convert 
        Armenia. Relics of Saint Gregory the Illuminator were brought here from 
        Naples and placed in a special reliquary, and soon after the consecration 
        Pope John Paul II visited this cathedral, highlighting its importance 
        for the Christian world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Architecturally the cathedral blends classic Armenian forms with clean, 
        contemporary lines, creating a vast, light-filled interior that feels 
        both monumental and calm. Standing in the open courtyard under the 54‑meter 
        bell tower, with the city spreading out below and Ararat often visible on 
        clear days, visitors get the sense that this is Yerevan’s own “modern pilgrimage 
        spot” – a place where history, faith and the new skyline meet in one frame.
