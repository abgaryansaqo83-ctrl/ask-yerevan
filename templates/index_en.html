          <h2>Armenia, seen through warm eyes</h2>
          <p>
            Armenia may look small on the map, but it is huge in memories:
            stone‑lined streets, sun‑soaked courtyards, villages hidden in the mountains,
            and a city that changes colour every morning.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Yerevan you can walk just a few minutes from old balconies and courtyards
            to bright cafés, warm bakeries and street musicians. Every street has its own story:
            sometimes ancient, sometimes new – but always alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            In AskYerevan you’ll find the places where this feeling lives: churches and temples,
            lakes and gorges, small neighbourhood cafés and streets glowing late into the night.
            Whether you want to fall in love with Yerevan again or discover Armenia for the first time,
            this is a good place to start.
