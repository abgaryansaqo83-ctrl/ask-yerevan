        <h2>The Kond House</h2>
        <h3>BBQ, wine and old Yerevan vibes on a rooftop terrace</h3>

        <p>
          Hidden in the narrow streets of Kond, one of the oldest neighborhoods of Yerevan,
          The Kond House feels more like visiting a friend’s backyard than going to a formal
          restaurant. A few steps up and you are already on a rooftop terrace with views over
          crooked roofs, hanging laundry and the city lights in the distance – a perfect mix
          of “old Yerevan” texture and modern comfort.
        </p>

        <p>
          The kitchen is all about hearty grill and home-style Armenian food: pork khorovats
          with a proper smoky crust, homemade sausages, trout or sterlet on skewers, big
          plates of village potatoes with herbs, and fresh salads like Greek or Caesar to
          share in the middle of the table. This is the kind of place where you order a set
          of mixed meats, a bottle of Armenian red wine or a Negroni from the cocktail list,
          and the evening naturally turns into a long, loud dinner with friends.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inside, a cozy bar serves coffee, classic cocktails and house drinks, while in the
          evenings the music and soft lights make the terrace feel almost like a small party
          hidden above the streets. It is easy to imagine starting with sunset photos over
          Kond, then slowly moving into grilled ribs, wine, a dessert and a strong nightcap –
          and leaving with the feeling that you have discovered one of Yerevan’s most
          atmospheric corners rather than “just another restaurant”.

      <h2>Ulikhanyan Club</h2>
      <h3>Jazz, wine and late-night sets on Sayat-Nova Avenue</h3>

      <p>
        Tucked in the basement at 7 Sayat-Nova Avenue, Ulikhanyan Club is one of those places
        where you go “just for one drink” and end up staying until the last encore. The room
        is small, brick-walled and intimate, with the stage almost within arm’s reach, so when
        the band starts playing jazz, fusion or ethno-jazz, you feel more like part of a
        private jam session than a big concert.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bar takes its drinks seriously: there is a solid wine list with Armenian reds and
        whites, classic cocktails from Old Fashioned and Negroni to dry Martinis, and a good
        selection of Armenian brandy for a slow late-night sip. It is the perfect combination
        with a jazz quartet on stage – a glass of reserve red wine, a plate of simple bar food
        and that moment when the saxophone solo fills the whole room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Live music is on almost every evening, from jam sessions on Mondays to ticketed
        concerts and festival-style lineups, and the crowd is a mix of musicians, locals and
        curious visitors who found the club by word of mouth. If you want to feel Yerevan’s
        night side without going to a noisy club, Ulikhanyan is exactly that sweet spot:
        dim lights, great sound, strong drinks and the feeling that you have discovered a
        small underground heart of the city’s music scene.

      <h2>Corpous Gastrobar</h2>
      <h3>“Taste the paradise” – from premium breakfast to late-night cocktails</h3>

      <p>
        Sitting right on Northern Avenue, Corpous Gastrobar is the kind of place you can
        visit both for a slow morning coffee and breakfast, and for cocktails and music
        late at night. Inside, it feels bright and modern, with large windows, soft armchairs
        and an open bar, so the atmosphere is both urban and warm – equally good for a group
        of friends or a more intimate date.
      </p>

      <p>
        The menu slides smoothly from breakfast to dinner: in the morning you can go for
        Eggs Benedict with salmon or an “Armenian Breakfast” with fresh bread, cheese and
        herbs, then switch to Mediterranean‑style plates like crispy calamari, fresh tuna
        tartare, truffle pasta or a nicely prepared beef carpaccio. Dessert is taken
        seriously too – syrniki with mango sauce, a proper cheesecake and other sweet
        plates that pair perfectly with a cappuccino or a glass of dessert wine.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bar has a full wine list and its own cocktail culture: elegant prosecco,
        carefully chosen reds and whites, plus signature cocktails that often appear on
        social media as “fresh drops” from the new menu. In the evening, when the lights
        of Northern Avenue come on, the soft music and clinking glasses turn the space
        into a cozy city lounge – the kind of night where you suddenly realize that this
        was not just a random stop, but a place you will want to come back to.
