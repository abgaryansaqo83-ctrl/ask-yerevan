        <h2>The Kond House</h2>
        <h3>BBQ, wine and old Yerevan vibes on a rooftop terrace</h3>

        <p>
          Hidden in the narrow streets of Kond, one of the oldest neighborhoods of Yerevan,
          The Kond House feels more like visiting a friend’s backyard than going to a formal
          restaurant. A few steps up and you are already on a rooftop terrace with views over
          crooked roofs, hanging laundry and the city lights in the distance – a perfect mix
          of “old Yerevan” texture and modern comfort.
        </p>

        <p>
          The kitchen is all about hearty grill and home-style Armenian food: pork khorovats
          with a proper smoky crust, homemade sausages, trout or sterlet on skewers, big
          plates of village potatoes with herbs, and fresh salads like Greek or Caesar to
          share in the middle of the table. This is the kind of place where you order a set
          of mixed meats, a bottle of Armenian red wine or a Negroni from the cocktail list,
          and the evening naturally turns into a long, loud dinner with friends.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inside, a cozy bar serves coffee, classic cocktails and house drinks, while in the
          evenings the music and soft lights make the terrace feel almost like a small party
          hidden above the streets. It is easy to imagine starting with sunset photos over
          Kond, then slowly moving into grilled ribs, wine, a dessert and a strong nightcap –
          and leaving with the feeling that you have discovered one of Yerevan’s most
          atmospheric corners rather than “just another restaurant”.
