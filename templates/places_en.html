        <h3>BBQ, wine and old Yerevan vibes on a rooftop terrace</h3>

        <p>
          Hidden in the narrow streets of Kond, one of the oldest neighborhoods of Yerevan,
          The Kond House feels more like visiting a friend’s backyard than going to a formal
          restaurant. A few steps up and you are already on a rooftop terrace with views over
          crooked roofs, hanging laundry and the city lights in the distance – a perfect mix
          of “old Yerevan” texture and modern comfort.
        </p>

        <p>
          The kitchen is all about hearty grill and home-style Armenian food: pork khorovats
          with a proper smoky crust, homemade sausages, trout or sterlet on skewers, big
          plates of village potatoes with herbs, and fresh salads like Greek or Caesar to
          share in the middle of the table. This is the kind of place where you order a set
          of mixed meats, a bottle of Armenian red wine or a Negroni from the cocktail list,
          and the evening naturally turns into a long, loud dinner with friends.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inside, a cozy bar serves coffee, classic cocktails and house drinks, while in the
          evenings the music and soft lights make the terrace feel almost like a small party
          hidden above the streets. It is easy to imagine starting with sunset photos over
          Kond, then slowly moving into grilled ribs, wine, a dessert and a strong nightcap –
          and leaving with the feeling that you have discovered one of Yerevan’s most
          atmospheric corners rather than “just another restaurant”.

      <h3>Jazz, wine and late-night sets on Sayat-Nova Avenue</h3>

      <p>
        Tucked in the basement at 7 Sayat-Nova Avenue, Ulikhanyan Club is one of those places
        where you go “just for one drink” and end up staying until the last encore. The room
        is small, brick-walled and intimate, with the stage almost within arm’s reach, so when
        the band starts playing jazz, fusion or ethno-jazz, you feel more like part of a
        private jam session than a big concert.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bar takes its drinks seriously: there is a solid wine list with Armenian reds and
        whites, classic cocktails from Old Fashioned and Negroni to dry Martinis, and a good
        selection of Armenian brandy for a slow late-night sip. It is the perfect combination
        with a jazz quartet on stage – a glass of reserve red wine, a plate of simple bar food
        and that moment when the saxophone solo fills the whole room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Live music is on almost every evening, from jam sessions on Mondays to ticketed
        concerts and festival-style lineups, and the crowd is a mix of musicians, locals and
        curious visitors who found the club by word of mouth. If you want to feel Yerevan’s
        night side without going to a noisy club, Ulikhanyan is exactly that sweet spot:
        dim lights, great sound, strong drinks and the feeling that you have discovered a
        small underground heart of the city’s music scene.

      <h3>“Taste the paradise” – from premium breakfast to late-night cocktails</h3>

      <p>
        Sitting right on Northern Avenue, Corpous Gastrobar is the kind of place you can
        visit both for a slow morning coffee and breakfast, and for cocktails and music
        late at night. Inside, it feels bright and modern, with large windows, soft armchairs
        and an open bar, so the atmosphere is both urban and warm – equally good for a group
        of friends or a more intimate date.
      </p>

      <p>
        The menu slides smoothly from breakfast to dinner: in the morning you can go for
        Eggs Benedict with salmon or an “Armenian Breakfast” with fresh bread, cheese and
        herbs, then switch to Mediterranean‑style plates like crispy calamari, fresh tuna
        tartare, truffle pasta or a nicely prepared beef carpaccio. Dessert is taken
        seriously too – syrniki with mango sauce, a proper cheesecake and other sweet
        plates that pair perfectly with a cappuccino or a glass of dessert wine.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bar has a full wine list and its own cocktail culture: elegant prosecco,
        carefully chosen reds and whites, plus signature cocktails that often appear on
        social media as “fresh drops” from the new menu. In the evening, when the lights
        of Northern Avenue come on, the soft music and clinking glasses turn the space
        into a cozy city lounge – the kind of night where you suddenly realize that this
        was not just a random stop, but a place you will want to come back to.

      <h3>Winter sports, summer views and a mountain day that always runs long</h3>

      <p>
        Tsaghkadzor is the kind of place where “we’ll just take the ropeway once and
        head back” almost never happens. In winter the town turns into a compact ski
        resort: soft snow, long runs and a ropeway that lifts you high above the
        valley, opening up wide panoramas of the surrounding mountains. Even if you
        have never skied before, simply sitting on the chairlift and watching the town
        slowly disappear below is enough to feel that this is not a regular day trip,
        but a small mountain adventure.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do ski or snowboard, Tsaghkadzor becomes your playground. You rent the
        gear on the spot, ride up, and after the first descent you stop counting
        hours. There are sleds and tubing, gentle slopes for kids and beginners, and
        steeper lines for those who want speed. After each run you can hide inside a
        small café for a hot chocolate or mulled wine, warm your hands and go back
        out again. What starts as “let’s just try one slope” usually turns into a
        full-on winter day.
      </p>

      <p>
        In summer Tsaghkadzor looks completely different. The same ropeway takes you
        over green hills and forests, into clear, cool mountain air where silence
        replaces the winter noise. At the top you can walk along the ridges, take
        photos of the mountain chain, have a small picnic or simply sit and watch the
        light move across the slopes. By the time you come back down in the evening,
        you feel like you have managed to ski, hike and recharge all in one day,
        without ever being too far from Yerevan.

      <h3>A warm day of swimming, cold drinks and absolutely no rush</h3>

      <p>
        Lake Sevan is where the sentence “the water might be a bit cold” usually ends
        with a splash. At the beach clubs your day starts with rows of sunbeds,
        comfy beanbags or wooden decks right by the water – everyone here has come
        for the same thing: to switch off from the city, feel the mountain sun on
        their skin and dive into the sharp, refreshing lake. On one side you have
        the bar and kitchen, on the other side the endless blue, and you move
        between them so naturally that “we’ll just swim a bit and leave” turns into
        something completely different.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can order light snacks – grilled Sevan trout, fish & chips, salads,
        veggie plates or simple pasta – the kind of food that inevitably gets shared
        around the whole table. The bar is in full summer mode with cold beer,
        chilled white wine, Aperol Spritz, frozen cocktails and non-alcoholic
        lemonades loaded with berries, lime or mint. This is one of those places
        where there is almost always a glass in your hand, but the real highlight
        is still the lake itself, shimmering just a few steps away.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the evening, as the sun starts to drop, the beach club turns into a
        small sunset venue. Lights come on, the music softens, and the water turns
        a deeper shade of blue. At that point it is hard to say whether you had
        “a beach day” or “a very long dinner by the lake”. What’s certain is that
        Sevan stops being just a blue spot on the map and becomes a place where you
        can swim, eat, drink and genuinely recharge – and promise yourself that
        next summer you’ll be back on this same shore.

      <h3>Wine, sunsets and vineyards just a short drive from Yerevan</h3>

      <p>
        Van Ardi is the kind of winery where you don’t just remember “we had a tour”,
        you remember a very specific evening – the sun already low, wind moving through
        the leaves, and a glass of deep red wine in your hand. Everything here is built
        to show that Armenian wine is not only history but a living craft, where each
        step from grape to bottle is intentional. You start by walking through the
        vineyards, hearing about the soil, climate and grape varieties, and then move
        into the cellar where the smell of oak barrels quietly takes over.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the tasting table you’ll find several wines – from lighter whites to deeper
        reds – paired with cheese, dried fruits, nuts and small plates that are there
        not to fill you up but to open up new layers in each sip. It is the kind of
        place where it feels natural to sit with friends, compare how a wine “opens up”
        on the second or third taste, and completely forget that just an hour earlier
        you were in city traffic.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the sun sets, Van Ardi turns almost cinematic. The vineyards fall into
        soft shadow, the stone buildings take on a golden glow, and every glass feels
        less like “the next one” and more like a small celebration. If you are looking
        for an evening where entertainment is not loud music but quality wine, fresh
        air and good company, Van Ardi is exactly the kind of place that makes Armenian
        wine feel personal rather than abstract.

      <h3>A classic tavern of black and red tuff, big portions and even bigger jokes</h3>

      <p>
        If you have ever wondered what a “real Gyumri tavern” looks like, Poloz Mukuch
        comes very close to that mental picture. A historic black and red tuff building,
        thick stone walls, heavy wooden doors and inside – staff who feed you and joke
        with you in equal measure. You don’t really come here for “a quick bite”, you
        come for the full package of hearty food, Gyumri humor and that slightly chaotic,
        warm atmosphere that feels more like a big family gathering than a restaurant.
      </p>

      <p>
        The table fills up quickly with khashlama, dolma, kebab, cold and hot salads,
        stacks of lavash and plates with sour-cream-and-garlic everything, plus glasses
        of red wine or beer to keep the conversation flowing. This is one of those
        places where the phrase “let’s order a little” disappears after the second
        plate, because every dish feels like something you absolutely need to try
        “just this once”. It is generous, unpretentious and designed for sharing.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the evening Poloz Mukuch turns into a small slice of Gyumri’s everyday life.
        Locals and visitors sit side by side, stories and jokes fly across the room and
        sometimes there is live music to tie it all together. If you want to understand
        why people call Gyumri the soulful, witty heart of Armenia, starting your
        evening at Poloz Mukuch is a very good idea – you walk out not only full, but
        also feeling a little more like a local than when you walked in.

      <h3>Warm lights, wooden walls and an evening that slowly grows from tea to wine</h3>

      <p>
        In Dilijan there is always at least one place that feels designed for rainy
        days – a wooden house tucked between trees, big windows, soft lights inside
        and wooden tables waiting for you. You walk in with the feeling of entering
        a hidden corner of the forest, take off your jacket and immediately sense
        that this is not a “quick coffee” spot but somewhere you can stay without
        watching the clock. It is less about rushing and more about unwinding.
      </p>

      <p>
        The menu treats both tea drinkers and wine lovers equally well. Big teapots
        with herbs, freshly baked cakes or tarts, local wines paired with small
        plates of cheese, dried fruits, nuts, olives and dips. There is always
        something on the table to share, while the background music – or sometimes
        the complete absence of it – leaves space for quiet reading or long, slow
        conversations. It is the kind of place where one cup easily turns into an
        entire evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        As it gets dark outside, the silhouettes of the trees line up behind the
        windows and the light inside becomes even warmer. That is when you realise
        that Dilijan is not only about daytime hikes and green forests, but also
        about evening spots where you can sit down, have a glass of wine or a pot
        of tea and let time slow down. If you are looking to escape the city not
        just by day but also in mood, this forest café/bar is exactly the stop you
        need.

      <h3>Hot waters, cool mountain air and an evening built for slowing down</h3>

      <p>
        In Jermuk the first impression is all about contrasts: cold mountain air
        outside, the smell of warm water and steam inside, and a quiet murmur of
        voices echoing through the spa halls. The resort hotels here immediately
        make it clear that this is not “just a quick trip out of town” but a small
        reset built around thermal pools and mineral springs. A short walk from
        your room to the pool is often enough to feel your muscles remember what
        relaxation is supposed to feel like.
      </p>

      <p>
        The warm indoor pool, hydromassage corners and sometimes even outdoor hot
        tubs on a terrace create a day where the only thing missing is a sense of
        rush. You can spend hours moving between water, rest areas and the bar for
        a glass of mineral water or herbal tea. Many places also offer massages,
        simple body treatments and face masks – nothing overly complicated, just
        enough to make you feel like you are being taken care of rather than
        entertaining yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the evening, when the mountains outside fade into the dark, the hotel
        lobby or lounge turns into a quiet social space. Armchairs, soft lighting,
        a pot of tea or a glass of wine, maybe a board game or a book – and no loud
        music to talk over. If your idea of “going out” includes resting your mind
        as much as your body, a Jermuk spa evening is exactly the kind of gentle
        entertainment that stays with you long after you leave the resort.

      <h3>A small room that somehow fits half of Yerevan’s nightlife</h3>

      <p>
        Calumet is one of those places where the room feels small but the atmosphere
        feels huge. Brick walls, flags, posters and tiny details make it feel like
        part living room, part secret club. You climb up a narrow staircase and
        suddenly step into a space where people are standing, sitting, laughing and
        talking – and even before the music starts you already know you are not
        leaving anytime soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most evenings there is either live music or at least carefully chosen tracks.
        Rock, folk, jazz and sometimes more ethnic sounds fill the room without
        creating a “big stage” distance – everything is up close, the musicians are
        almost within arm’s reach. At the bar you can get beer, wine or simple mixed
        drinks that feel like part of a friendly night out rather than a show. This
        is the kind of place you go to for an evening, not just for a quick round.
      </p>

      <p>
        Calumet often feels larger than its physical size because of the people who
        gather there. Strangers start talking, chairs and tables move around, new
        groups form. If you want a spot in Yerevan where you can hear good music,
        meet interesting people and still not feel lost in a crowd, this small bar
        is exactly that kind of place.

      <h3>Craft beer, big tables and a place made for long conversations</h3>

      <p>
        Dargett is not just a place that “serves beer” – it is where beer feels like
        the main story. Large tanks, visible pipes, long wooden tables and benches
        set the tone for evenings that are meant to be shared. The atmosphere is
        lively but not overwhelming: there is always a comfortable level of noise,
        enough to feel the energy, yet still possible to hear the person sitting
        across from you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fun part is exploring the beers themselves. You can order a tasting
        board with several small glasses and move from pale to dark, from light and
        fruity to deep and bitter. It is the kind of place where friends end up
        comparing notes on every sip, rediscovering which style they actually like.
        Food keeps pace with the glasses – burgers, fries, pizza and other plates
        designed for sharing and for pairing with what is in your glass.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the evenings Dargett fills up with groups of friends, colleagues and
        travellers who all want roughly the same thing: to relax without making a
        big production out of it. If you are looking for a spot in Yerevan where
        beer is taken seriously but the mood stays relaxed and friendly, Dargett is
        exactly that kind of brewpub. You leave not only satisfied with what you
        drank and ate, but also with the feeling that the city is a bit warmer and
        more familiar.

      <h3>A small, dim cocktail bar where the night slows down</h3>

      <p>
        While many Yerevan bars are loud and open, Simona feels more like stepping into
        a secret living room. You walk down a narrow staircase, pass through a rather
        unassuming entrance and suddenly end up in a low-lit room with wooden tables,
        vintage details and a long bar that seems to hold the whole place together.
        It is intimate without being pretentious, the kind of bar where you quickly
        stop checking your phone and simply let the evening unfold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cocktails are the main reason to come here. The bartenders are skilled and
        patient, happy to guide you through the menu or improvise something based on
        what you like. Drinks are often on the smaller, stronger side, with layered
        flavors and playful combinations rather than just sweet crowd-pleasers.
        This is the place to sit at the bar, watch the whole process and treat each
        drink as part of the experience rather than just a way to pass time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Simona also has its own soundtrack. Expect vinyl, eclectic selections and
        a mood that can gently drift from background listening to subtle dance
        moments as the night grows later. You may find designers, musicians,
        locals and visitors all sharing the same space without it ever feeling
        like a typical tourist bar. If you want to understand Yerevan’s quieter,
        more cinematic nightlife, Simona is an excellent place to start.

      <h3>A small rock club where the night is always loud</h3>

      <p>
        Stop Club is not the place to go for quiet cocktails and slow conversations.
        It is a compact rock venue with a low stage, focused lights and a room that
        fills up quickly once the band starts playing. The interior is simple and
        a bit rough around the edges, but that is exactly the point: this is a bar
        built around music first, everything else second.
      </p>

      <p>
        On most nights you will find a live band on stage – local rock and metal,
        blues, indie, covers and the occasional experimental project. The drinks
        list is straightforward, with beer and classic bar staples doing most of
        the heavy lifting, while the real action is happening a few meters away
        under the stage lights. It is easy to end up talking to regulars, musicians
        and visitors between sets, especially if you drift toward the bar area.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stop Club has the feel of an old-school rock bar that somehow survived
        into the present. It attracts students, long-time rock fans and anyone
        who prefers guitars and live vocals over DJ sets and polished interiors.
        If you want to experience Yerevan’s louder, sweatier and more unfiltered
        side of nightlife, an evening at Stop Club is a very good starting point.

      <h3>The place where Gyumri’s nights turn into concerts</h3>

      <p>
        Garage Club is one of the main reasons Gyumri has a nightlife at all.
        It is a compact, slightly rough-around-the-edges club where the focus is
        firmly on live music and the people who come to listen to it. By day
        Gyumri is all stone buildings and dry humor; by night a big part of that
        energy gathers here in front of the stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The program usually includes rock bands, blues, covers, local projects
        and occasional guests from Yerevan or abroad. Drinks are straightforward
        and unpretentious – beer, simple cocktails and a few snacks – because the
        main attraction is what happens under the lights, not what is written on
        the menu. It is easy to end up staying longer than planned, drifting
        between the bar, the crowd and the stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Garage Club is also a good place to meet Gyumri itself. Students,
        artists, IT people, locals and visitors end up together in the same small
        room, creating a mood that feels different from Yerevan’s polished bars.
        If you want to experience a more raw, local version of Armenian nightlife
        outside the capital, an evening at Garage Club in Gyumri is a strong choice.

      <h3>Live music nights in the very center of Yerevan</h3>

      <p>
        Kami Music Club is tucked just behind Moscow Cinema on Abovyan Street,
        but once you step downstairs it feels like its own little world.
        A compact stage, focused lighting and a room full of tables and bar seats
        create a setting where live music is clearly the main event.
        It is central and easy to reach, yet separated enough from the street to
        let the evening take its time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The program ranges from rock and pop covers to jazz, funk and vocal
        projects, with themed nights and guest musicians showing up regularly.
        The bar is part of the show: you can order wine,
        beer or cocktails and simply watch the bartenders work while the band
        plays a few meters away. It is a good place both for sitting
        with friends at a table and for slowly drifting closer to the stage as
        the night gets louder.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kami is especially convenient if you are exploring Yerevan’s center and
        want to end the day with live music without leaving the area.
        Republic Square, Northern Avenue and the Cascade are all within walking
        distance, so it is easy to add Kami to an evening walk. If you want a
        mix of central location, a proper stage and a club that still feels
        personal, Kami Music Club fits that combination well.

        the terrace, which opens directly onto the square with full views of the
        buildings, fountains and the flow of people below.
        It feels less like being in a closed restaurant and more like having your
        own balcony above the city.
      </p>

      <p>
        The menu combines familiar Armenian dishes with international restaurant
        staples – salads, grilled mains, wine and cocktails suitable for a slow
        evening. Still, the real highlight is the scene in
        front of you: the illuminated facades, the clock tower and, on some
        evenings, the dancing fountains if you time it right.
        It is an easy place to bring visitors when you want food and a classic
        postcard view in one spot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Diamond works especially well at dusk and later into the night, when the
        square lights up but the air is still comfortable enough to sit outside. 
        If you want to experience the center of Yerevan without
        standing in the middle of the square, this terrace gives you a slightly
        detached, panoramic version of it.

      <h3>A large apricot orchard for long family-style lunches</h3>

      <p>
        Tsirani Garden Restaurant is located just outside Yerevan, in the village
        of Arinj, on Marshal Babajanyan 3/1. It is a spacious
        garden complex of around 4 hectares, filled with apricot trees, small
        ponds, paths and wooden pavilions scattered across the area.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of a single dining hall, you get dozens of outdoor gazebos and
        several indoor halls, which makes it feel more like a countryside escape
        than a classic city restaurant. Locals often choose it
        for big celebrations such as weddings, birthdays and family gatherings,
        but it also works for a long weekend lunch with friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        The menu focuses on traditional Armenian dishes – grilled meats, kebabs,
        roasted vegetables, fresh salads, pickles, lavash and rich desserts. 
        Guests praise the green setting and generous portions,
        while also noting that service can slow down on very busy days, simply
        because of the size of the complex.

      <h3>Classic Armenian dishes in an intimate, living-room style space</h3>

      <p>
        Dolmama is one of Yerevan’s best-known Armenian restaurants, set in a small
        townhouse just off the city center. With its paintings, vintage details and
        compact rooms, it feels more like visiting someone’s home than sitting in a
        large formal dining hall.
      </p>

      <p>
        The restaurant is named after its signature dish – dolma – and offers several
        variations alongside other Armenian classics presented with a slightly lighter,
        more contemporary touch. Presentation is careful, portions are thoughtfully
        sized and the wine list is curated to match the rich, home-style flavors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolmama is popular with both locals and visitors, so reservations are usually
        a good idea, especially for dinner. If you are looking for a place to get a
        focused introduction to Armenian cuisine in a warm, intimate setting, this
        small restaurant is a very solid choice.

      <h3>Lake views, fresh fish and a calm, modern dining room</h3>

      <p>
        Yasaman Sevan is set right on the shore of Lake Sevan, in Tsovagyugh, so
        the lake is part of the experience from the moment you sit down. Large
        windows and an open terrace frame the water and mountains, making it feel
        more like a lakeside retreat than a stop on the highway.
      </p>

      <p>
        The menu focuses on Sevan’s freshwater fish, prepared in different ways –
        grilled, baked, or served with light sauces that let the main ingredient
        stay in the foreground. Alongside the fish you will find Armenian and
        Mediterranean-style starters, salads and sides that keep the overall
        feeling fresh rather than heavy.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is a good place to plan as part of a day by the lake: walk along the
        shore, then sit down for a slow lunch or dinner while the light changes
        over the water. If you want a restaurant that feels clearly connected to
        Sevan itself, Yasaman is one of the most comfortable and scenic options.

      <h3>Open kitchen, modern Armenian flavors and a prime central location</h3>

      <p>
        Sherep sits on Amiryan Street, just steps away from Republic Square, and
        has become one of the go-to modern restaurants in Yerevan. The dining room
        is large and lively, with high ceilings, big windows and a steady mix of
        locals and visitors.
      </p>

      <p>
        The open kitchen is the visual centerpiece: you can watch chefs grilling,
        baking and plating dishes in real time. The menu blends Armenian and
        regional influences with more contemporary restaurant-style presentations,
        from grilled meats and stews to fresh salads and shareable starters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sherep works equally well for a big group dinner or a smaller evening out,
        thanks to its energetic but not overly formal atmosphere. If you have to
        choose just one central restaurant in Yerevan that will likely please
        different tastes in one go, this is a very safe and satisfying option.
