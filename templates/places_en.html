        <h2>The Kond House</h2>
        <h3>BBQ, wine and old Yerevan vibes on a rooftop terrace</h3>

        <p>
          Hidden in the narrow streets of Kond, one of the oldest neighborhoods of Yerevan,
          The Kond House feels more like visiting a friend’s backyard than going to a formal
          restaurant. A few steps up and you are already on a rooftop terrace with views over
          crooked roofs, hanging laundry and the city lights in the distance – a perfect mix
          of “old Yerevan” texture and modern comfort.
        </p>

        <p>
          The kitchen is all about hearty grill and home-style Armenian food: pork khorovats
          with a proper smoky crust, homemade sausages, trout or sterlet on skewers, big
          plates of village potatoes with herbs, and fresh salads like Greek or Caesar to
          share in the middle of the table. This is the kind of place where you order a set
          of mixed meats, a bottle of Armenian red wine or a Negroni from the cocktail list,
          and the evening naturally turns into a long, loud dinner with friends.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inside, a cozy bar serves coffee, classic cocktails and house drinks, while in the
          evenings the music and soft lights make the terrace feel almost like a small party
          hidden above the streets. It is easy to imagine starting with sunset photos over
          Kond, then slowly moving into grilled ribs, wine, a dessert and a strong nightcap –
          and leaving with the feeling that you have discovered one of Yerevan’s most
          atmospheric corners rather than “just another restaurant”.

      <h2>Ulikhanyan Club</h2>
      <h3>Jazz, wine and late-night sets on Sayat-Nova Avenue</h3>

      <p>
        Tucked in the basement at 7 Sayat-Nova Avenue, Ulikhanyan Club is one of those places
        where you go “just for one drink” and end up staying until the last encore. The room
        is small, brick-walled and intimate, with the stage almost within arm’s reach, so when
        the band starts playing jazz, fusion or ethno-jazz, you feel more like part of a
        private jam session than a big concert.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bar takes its drinks seriously: there is a solid wine list with Armenian reds and
        whites, classic cocktails from Old Fashioned and Negroni to dry Martinis, and a good
        selection of Armenian brandy for a slow late-night sip. It is the perfect combination
        with a jazz quartet on stage – a glass of reserve red wine, a plate of simple bar food
        and that moment when the saxophone solo fills the whole room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Live music is on almost every evening, from jam sessions on Mondays to ticketed
        concerts and festival-style lineups, and the crowd is a mix of musicians, locals and
        curious visitors who found the club by word of mouth. If you want to feel Yerevan’s
        night side without going to a noisy club, Ulikhanyan is exactly that sweet spot:
        dim lights, great sound, strong drinks and the feeling that you have discovered a
        small underground heart of the city’s music scene.

      <h2>Corpous Gastrobar</h2>
      <h3>“Taste the paradise” – from premium breakfast to late-night cocktails</h3>

      <p>
        Sitting right on Northern Avenue, Corpous Gastrobar is the kind of place you can
        visit both for a slow morning coffee and breakfast, and for cocktails and music
        late at night. Inside, it feels bright and modern, with large windows, soft armchairs
        and an open bar, so the atmosphere is both urban and warm – equally good for a group
        of friends or a more intimate date.
      </p>

      <p>
        The menu slides smoothly from breakfast to dinner: in the morning you can go for
        Eggs Benedict with salmon or an “Armenian Breakfast” with fresh bread, cheese and
        herbs, then switch to Mediterranean‑style plates like crispy calamari, fresh tuna
        tartare, truffle pasta or a nicely prepared beef carpaccio. Dessert is taken
        seriously too – syrniki with mango sauce, a proper cheesecake and other sweet
        plates that pair perfectly with a cappuccino or a glass of dessert wine.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bar has a full wine list and its own cocktail culture: elegant prosecco,
        carefully chosen reds and whites, plus signature cocktails that often appear on
        social media as “fresh drops” from the new menu. In the evening, when the lights
        of Northern Avenue come on, the soft music and clinking glasses turn the space
        into a cozy city lounge – the kind of night where you suddenly realize that this
        was not just a random stop, but a place you will want to come back to.

      <h2>Tsaghkadzor Ski Resort & Ropeway</h2>
      <h3>Winter sports, summer views and a mountain day that always runs long</h3>

      <p>
        Tsaghkadzor is the kind of place where “we’ll just take the ropeway once and
        head back” almost never happens. In winter the town turns into a compact ski
        resort: soft snow, long runs and a ropeway that lifts you high above the
        valley, opening up wide panoramas of the surrounding mountains. Even if you
        have never skied before, simply sitting on the chairlift and watching the town
        slowly disappear below is enough to feel that this is not a regular day trip,
        but a small mountain adventure.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do ski or snowboard, Tsaghkadzor becomes your playground. You rent the
        gear on the spot, ride up, and after the first descent you stop counting
        hours. There are sleds and tubing, gentle slopes for kids and beginners, and
        steeper lines for those who want speed. After each run you can hide inside a
        small café for a hot chocolate or mulled wine, warm your hands and go back
        out again. What starts as “let’s just try one slope” usually turns into a
        full-on winter day.
      </p>

      <p>
        In summer Tsaghkadzor looks completely different. The same ropeway takes you
        over green hills and forests, into clear, cool mountain air where silence
        replaces the winter noise. At the top you can walk along the ridges, take
        photos of the mountain chain, have a small picnic or simply sit and watch the
        light move across the slopes. By the time you come back down in the evening,
        you feel like you have managed to ski, hike and recharge all in one day,
        without ever being too far from Yerevan.

      <h2>Lake Sevan Beach & Sunset Chill</h2>
      <h3>A warm day of swimming, cold drinks and absolutely no rush</h3>

      <p>
        Lake Sevan is where the sentence “the water might be a bit cold” usually ends
        with a splash. At the beach clubs your day starts with rows of sunbeds,
        comfy beanbags or wooden decks right by the water – everyone here has come
        for the same thing: to switch off from the city, feel the mountain sun on
        their skin and dive into the sharp, refreshing lake. On one side you have
        the bar and kitchen, on the other side the endless blue, and you move
        between them so naturally that “we’ll just swim a bit and leave” turns into
        something completely different.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can order light snacks – grilled Sevan trout, fish & chips, salads,
        veggie plates or simple pasta – the kind of food that inevitably gets shared
        around the whole table. The bar is in full summer mode with cold beer,
        chilled white wine, Aperol Spritz, frozen cocktails and non-alcoholic
        lemonades loaded with berries, lime or mint. This is one of those places
        where there is almost always a glass in your hand, but the real highlight
        is still the lake itself, shimmering just a few steps away.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the evening, as the sun starts to drop, the beach club turns into a
        small sunset venue. Lights come on, the music softens, and the water turns
        a deeper shade of blue. At that point it is hard to say whether you had
        “a beach day” or “a very long dinner by the lake”. What’s certain is that
        Sevan stops being just a blue spot on the map and becomes a place where you
        can swim, eat, drink and genuinely recharge – and promise yourself that
        next summer you’ll be back on this same shore.

    <div class="place-text">
      <h2>Van Ardi Winery</h2>
      <h3>Wine, sunsets and vineyards just a short drive from Yerevan</h3>

      <p>
        Van Ardi is the kind of winery where you don’t just remember “we had a tour”,
        you remember a very specific evening – the sun already low, wind moving through
        the leaves, and a glass of deep red wine in your hand. Everything here is built
        to show that Armenian wine is not only history but a living craft, where each
        step from grape to bottle is intentional. You start by walking through the
        vineyards, hearing about the soil, climate and grape varieties, and then move
        into the cellar where the smell of oak barrels quietly takes over.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the tasting table you’ll find several wines – from lighter whites to deeper
        reds – paired with cheese, dried fruits, nuts and small plates that are there
        not to fill you up but to open up new layers in each sip. It is the kind of
        place where it feels natural to sit with friends, compare how a wine “opens up”
        on the second or third taste, and completely forget that just an hour earlier
        you were in city traffic.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the sun sets, Van Ardi turns almost cinematic. The vineyards fall into
        soft shadow, the stone buildings take on a golden glow, and every glass feels
        less like “the next one” and more like a small celebration. If you are looking
        for an evening where entertainment is not loud music but quality wine, fresh
        air and good company, Van Ardi is exactly the kind of place that makes Armenian
        wine feel personal rather than abstract.

      <h2>Poloz Mukuch – Gyumri’s Humor on a Plate</h2>
      <h3>A classic tavern of black and red tuff, big portions and even bigger jokes</h3>

      <p>
        If you have ever wondered what a “real Gyumri tavern” looks like, Poloz Mukuch
        comes very close to that mental picture. A historic black and red tuff building,
        thick stone walls, heavy wooden doors and inside – staff who feed you and joke
        with you in equal measure. You don’t really come here for “a quick bite”, you
        come for the full package of hearty food, Gyumri humor and that slightly chaotic,
        warm atmosphere that feels more like a big family gathering than a restaurant.
      </p>

      <p>
        The table fills up quickly with khashlama, dolma, kebab, cold and hot salads,
        stacks of lavash and plates with sour-cream-and-garlic everything, plus glasses
        of red wine or beer to keep the conversation flowing. This is one of those
        places where the phrase “let’s order a little” disappears after the second
        plate, because every dish feels like something you absolutely need to try
        “just this once”. It is generous, unpretentious and designed for sharing.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the evening Poloz Mukuch turns into a small slice of Gyumri’s everyday life.
        Locals and visitors sit side by side, stories and jokes fly across the room and
        sometimes there is live music to tie it all together. If you want to understand
        why people call Gyumri the soulful, witty heart of Armenia, starting your
        evening at Poloz Mukuch is a very good idea – you walk out not only full, but
        also feeling a little more like a local than when you walked in.

      <h2>Forest Café/Bar in Dilijan</h2>
      <h3>Warm lights, wooden walls and an evening that slowly grows from tea to wine</h3>

      <p>
        In Dilijan there is always at least one place that feels designed for rainy
        days – a wooden house tucked between trees, big windows, soft lights inside
        and wooden tables waiting for you. You walk in with the feeling of entering
        a hidden corner of the forest, take off your jacket and immediately sense
        that this is not a “quick coffee” spot but somewhere you can stay without
        watching the clock. It is less about rushing and more about unwinding.
      </p>

      <p>
        The menu treats both tea drinkers and wine lovers equally well. Big teapots
        with herbs, freshly baked cakes or tarts, local wines paired with small
        plates of cheese, dried fruits, nuts, olives and dips. There is always
        something on the table to share, while the background music – or sometimes
        the complete absence of it – leaves space for quiet reading or long, slow
        conversations. It is the kind of place where one cup easily turns into an
        entire evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        As it gets dark outside, the silhouettes of the trees line up behind the
        windows and the light inside becomes even warmer. That is when you realise
        that Dilijan is not only about daytime hikes and green forests, but also
        about evening spots where you can sit down, have a glass of wine or a pot
        of tea and let time slow down. If you are looking to escape the city not
        just by day but also in mood, this forest café/bar is exactly the stop you
        need.

      <h2>Jermuk Spa Resort</h2>
      <h3>Hot waters, cool mountain air and an evening built for slowing down</h3>

      <p>
        In Jermuk the first impression is all about contrasts: cold mountain air
        outside, the smell of warm water and steam inside, and a quiet murmur of
        voices echoing through the spa halls. The resort hotels here immediately
        make it clear that this is not “just a quick trip out of town” but a small
        reset built around thermal pools and mineral springs. A short walk from
        your room to the pool is often enough to feel your muscles remember what
        relaxation is supposed to feel like.
      </p>

      <p>
        The warm indoor pool, hydromassage corners and sometimes even outdoor hot
        tubs on a terrace create a day where the only thing missing is a sense of
        rush. You can spend hours moving between water, rest areas and the bar for
        a glass of mineral water or herbal tea. Many places also offer massages,
        simple body treatments and face masks – nothing overly complicated, just
        enough to make you feel like you are being taken care of rather than
        entertaining yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the evening, when the mountains outside fade into the dark, the hotel
        lobby or lounge turns into a quiet social space. Armchairs, soft lighting,
        a pot of tea or a glass of wine, maybe a board game or a book – and no loud
        music to talk over. If your idea of “going out” includes resting your mind
        as much as your body, a Jermuk spa evening is exactly the kind of gentle
        entertainment that stays with you long after you leave the resort.
