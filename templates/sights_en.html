      <h2>Garni Pagan Temple</h2>
      <h3>1st‑century temple in the Artaxiad summer residence</h3>

      <p>
        The temple of Garni was built in the 1st century and dedicated to the
        sun god Mihr. It is the only fully preserved Hellenistic‑style pagan
        temple in Armenia, with Ionic columns and a high podium.
      </p>

      <p>
        The temple was part of a royal summer residence complex with baths,
        halls and defensive walls, and below it opens the view of the Azat
        gorge and the “Symphony of Stones” basalt columns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today Garni is one of Armenia’s most famous sights and a venue for
        open‑air concerts, festivals and events where ancient architecture
        meets contemporary culture.
