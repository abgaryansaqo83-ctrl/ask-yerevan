      <h3>1st‑century temple in the Artaxiad summer residence</h3>

      <p>
        The temple of Garni was built in the 1st century and was dedicated to
        the sun god Mihr. It is the only fully preserved Hellenistic‑style
        pagan temple in Armenia, with Ionic columns and a high podium.
      </p>

      <p>
        The temple was part of a royal summer residence complex with baths,
        reception halls and defensive walls, and below it opens the view of the
        Azat gorge and the “Symphony of Stones” basalt columns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today Garni is one of Armenia’s most famous sights, a venue for open‑air
        concerts, festivals and events where ancient architecture meets
        contemporary culture.

      <h3>The “jewel of Armenia” – a high‑mountain lake at 1900 m</h3>

      <p>
        Lake Sevan is Armenia’s largest body of water and one of the biggest
        high‑altitude freshwater lakes in the world. It lies at about
        1900 meters above sea level and is often called the “jewel of Armenia”
        or the country’s “blue eye”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lake Sevan is like Armenia’s blue eye: a huge mirror set between
        mountains that changes color with the time of day and the seasons –
        pale blue in the morning, bright and sparkling at noon, and glowing
        crimson at sunset.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lake is surrounded by mountain ranges, while its shores are lined
        with beaches, resorts and small villages. Here you can swim, go out
        on a boat, relax in tiny bays with wooden huts and floating decks, and
        listen to the wind moving the waves while familiar mountains close the
        horizon on all sides. You can camp on the shore and try famous Sevan
        trout and other local fish dishes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Locals like to say that Sevan “looks at people” like an eye and that
        the weather changes with its mood: on calm days the lake is smooth as
        a mirror, while during storms it seems offended and sends high waves
        crashing onto the shore. At night the stars feel so close to the water
        that it seems you could almost reach out and pick them up.

      <h3>A small mountain lake in the heart of Dilijan National Park</h3>

      <p>
        Parz Lake is a small mountain lake hidden in the forests of Dilijan National Park,
        at about 1,330 meters above sea level. Its calm, mirror-like surface
        reflects the surrounding trees and sky, which makes it one of the most photogenic
        spots in the area.
      </p>

      <p>
        A gentle loop trail of roughly 2 km goes around the lake, so you can take an easy
        walk, stop at viewpoints and watch how the forest slowly descends all the way down
        to the water. The path is suitable even for non-experienced hikers,
        which makes Parz Lake a good option for light hiking and family-friendly walks.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the lakeshore there are small cafés, picnic spots and pavilions, and in season
        you can rent a boat or pedal boat to see the forest and mountains from the water
        itself. Many visitors bring their own snacks or picnic,
        sit close to the water and simply listen to the sounds of the forest – birds,
        wind and the quiet splash of the lake.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spring, the hills around Parz Lake turn bright green, while in autumn the forest
        becomes a mix of gold and red tones. Even in summer it usually feels
        cooler here than in the city, so an hour by the lake often feels like a whole day
        of real rest.

      <h3>A giant natural basalt organ beneath the Garni Temple</h3>

      <p>
        Just below the Temple of Garni, the road drops down into a canyon where one 
        of Armenia’s most surreal landscapes is hiding: a vertical wall of perfectly 
        shaped hexagonal and pentagonal basalt columns, hanging from the cliff like 
        the pipes of a giant church organ [web:69][web:70][web:77]. This is the famous 
        Symphony of Stones.
      </p>

      <p>
        What looks almost man‑made is actually pure geology: long ago, lava flowed 
        through this gorge and cooled so slowly that it cracked into near–perfect 
        geometric columns [web:69][web:71][web:80]. Over thousands of years, the Azat River 
        carved the rock away, revealing a 40–50 meter high façade of stone “pipes” 
        that now tower above the road and river.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can visit the gorge on the same day as the Garni Temple: either drive 
        down the cobblestone road into the canyon or walk from the village and cross 
        the medieval stone bridge [web:70][web:74][web:75]. On one side the basalt organ wall 
        leans over you; on the other, the river runs between boulders—every few meters 
        there is another angle that demands a photo.
      </p>

      <p>
        For anyone who loves dramatic landscapes, strange rock formations and places 
        that feel like a fantasy movie set, Garni Gorge is an easy “must‑visit” [web:69][web:78][web:75]. 
        It is the kind of place where you come for “just a quick stop” and end up 
        staying longer, simply standing under the columns, listening to the river 
        and wondering how nature managed to build something this precise.

      <h3>A 3,200‑meter alpine lake and gateway to Mount Aragats</h3>

      <p>
        Kari Lake is one of Armenia’s most striking high‑altitude lakes, resting on 
        the southern slope of Mount Aragats at about 3,200 meters above sea level. 
        When you step out of the car, it feels like you’ve arrived on a separate plateau 
        above the world: cold, clear water, rocky slopes and huge skies in every direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lake is reached by a paved but winding mountain road that climbs up from 
        the Byurakan side all the way to the shore. In summer there are 
        small cafés and guesthouses, while in late autumn and winter the road is often 
        blocked by snow and the whole area turns into a white, silent landscape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kari Lake is also the classic starting point for hiking the southern summit 
        of Aragats: the trail to the peak begins right by the water and quickly climbs 
        into rough, volcanic terrain. Even if you don’t plan to reach 
        the summit, a short walk up the path gives you increasingly wide views over 
        the lake and the surrounding mountains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of the altitude, the air is sharp and refreshing, and the lake water 
        stays ice‑cold even in July. Some brave visitors take a quick dip, 
        but for most people the real luxury here is simply sitting by the shore, 
        watching the light change on the water and feeling how far everyday life has 
        suddenly moved away.

      <h3>Armenia’s “Little Switzerland” with old streets and forested hills</h3>

      <p>
        Dilijan is where people go to slow down for a while: forested hills, cool 
        mountain air, old wooden balconies and a rhythm that feels a few beats 
        softer than the rest of the country։ On one side you have 
        a small town with Soviet blocks; on the other, a carefully preserved old 
        quarter that feels like stepping back in time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The heart of old Dilijan is Sharambeyan Street, lined with 19th‑century 
        stone houses, carved wooden balconies, craft workshops and cozy cafés։ 
        Here you can watch artisans working with wood, clay or textiles, buy 
        handmade souvenirs, or simply sit on a balcony with a coffee and look 
        down the cobblestone street.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the center of town, Dilijan City Park offers a different kind of calm: 
        a small lake, tall trees, winding paths and benches where locals come to 
        chat, walk dogs or let kids run around։ In autumn the park 
        explodes in reds and golds; in spring it turns bright green and feels like 
        a miniature version of the surrounding national park.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dilijan also makes a perfect base for exploring the wider area: the trails 
        of Dilijan National Park, Parz Lake, mountain viewpoints and nearby 
        monasteries like Haghartsin and Goshavank if you want to add a spiritual 
        touch to your trip։ But even if you never leave the town, 
        a day spent wandering the old street and sitting in the park is enough to 
        understand why people call Dilijan “Little Switzerland of Armenia.”

      <h3>Black tuff houses, cobblestones and a living open‑air museum</h3>

      <p>
        Gyumri’s old town, the Kumayri historic district, feels like a full‑scale 
        open‑air museum: more than a thousand buildings from the 19th and early 
        20th centuries, many of them built from dark volcanic tuff stone. The 
        mixture of Armenian and European styles, ornate balconies and wide 
        sidewalks gives the city a character found nowhere else in Armenia.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best way to see Gyumri is simply to walk: follow the cobblestone 
        streets around Vardanants Square, Abovyan or Rizhkov streets, and look up 
        at the facades that still carry both decorative details and scars from 
        past earthquakes. That combination of beauty and roughness is exactly 
        what makes the city so compelling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Along the way you will find small cafés, artists’ studios and antique 
        shops tucked into old buildings. Step into a courtyard and you might 
        see laundry hanging, children playing, and neighbors chatting across 
        balconies—Gyumri’s famous sense of humor and warmth lives in these 
        hidden corners just as much as on the main streets.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you like cities that are a bit imperfect, a bit weathered, but full 
        of soul, Gyumri’s old town is an essential stop. It is the kind of place 
        where you plan a half‑day visit and end up staying overnight, just to 
        wander the streets again in the evening light and feel the city’s 
        personality settle in.

      <h3>An abandoned cave city and a long suspension bridge in Syunik</h3>

      <p>
        Old Khndzoresk is not just a village, but a whole cave city stretched along 
        the walls of a deep gorge. For centuries people lived inside these man‑made 
        caves, carving out rooms, barns and storage spaces in the rock and building 
        facades in front of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today the modern village sits above, while the old settlement is reached by 
        a long stairway and a 160‑meter suspension bridge that connects the two sides 
        of the canyon. Standing in the middle of the bridge, you see the caves 
        scattered across the cliffs and feel just how dramatic the landscape really is.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the caves are easy to enter and still show traces of everyday life: 
        soot‑blackened ceilings, niches carved into the walls, half‑collapsed rooms 
        where families once cooked, slept and kept animals. Others are high up, 
        accessible only to climbers, which makes the entire hillside look like a 
        giant natural apartment block.
      </p>

      <p>
        Khndzoresk is perfect if you like places that are a bit wild and a bit raw. 
        The path down into the gorge, the gentle sway of the bridge and the silence 
        inside the caves all combine into an experience that feels far away from 
        paved city life—and very easy to remember long after you leave.

      <h3>Armenia’s Stonehenge on a windswept plateau in Syunik</h3>

      <p>
        Karahunj, also known as Zorats Karer, is one of those places where you 
        arrive, look around and immediately feel that something ancient and 
        important happened here. Hundreds of standing stones are scattered across 
        a high plateau, many of them with perfectly round holes drilled near the top.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one can say with absolute certainty what Karahunj was, but theories 
        range from prehistoric observatory and ritual site to a vast cemetery or 
        a combination of all three. What matters on the ground is the feeling: 
        this was clearly more than just a random pile of rocks.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you walk between the stones, you notice lines, inner circles, “arms” 
        extending from the main group and solitary stones that seem to point in 
        very deliberate directions. At sunrise and sunset the light slices through 
        the gaps and holes, casting long shadows and turning the whole site into 
        a natural light installation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Visiting Karahunj is not about museums or signboards—it is about open sky, 
        wind and stones. There are no big facilities here, just the plateau and 
        the view, which makes it easy to imagine how people thousands of years 
        ago stood in the same place, looking at the same horizon and reading the 
        sky in a language we no longer fully understand.

      <h3>A medieval “fortress in the clouds” on Mount Aragats</h3>

      <p>
        The name Amberd says it all: in Armenian it literally means “fortress in the clouds”. 
        The stronghold sits at about 2,300 meters above sea level on the slopes of Mount Aragats, 
        right where two deep gorges meet. For centuries this was a lookout point and a shield 
        guarding mountain passes and trade routes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of what you see today dates back to the 10th–13th centuries, when Armenian noble 
        families controlled the area and turned Amberd into a serious military base. It later 
        fell to invading armies and was abandoned, but its thick walls and towers still hold 
        the outline of a fortress that was once very hard to conquer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside the complex you find the remains of defensive walls, towers and a small but 
        very photogenic church dedicated to the Holy Mother of God. Walking along the edges 
        of the fortress, you look straight down into the gorge and out towards the peaks of 
        Aragats—it is easy to see why this place was chosen as a stronghold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Local stories add an extra layer of drama: some versions tell of a woman who refused 
        to surrender to the attacking army and chose to leave the safety of the fortress, 
        disappearing into the depths of the gorge instead. Whether or not the legend is true, 
        it fits the mood of Amberd on a cloudy evening, when mist rises from the valley and 
        the silence feels almost theatrical.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amberd is an ideal stop if you are already heading towards Aragats or Lake Kari. 
        It combines mountain scenery, medieval architecture and a tangible sense of history 
        in one compact site—and gives you that rare feeling of standing in a place that has 
        literally watched over the land from above for many centuries.

      <h3>An 18‑metre waterfall hidden in a green gorge in Syunik</h3>

      <p>
        Shaki Waterfall is one of Armenia’s most beautiful and accessible waterfalls. 
        The water drops about 18 metres from a basalt ledge, breaking into dozens of 
        thin streams that together form a powerful white curtain. After a short walk 
        from the parking area, you suddenly hear the roar of water before you even 
        see the falls.
      </p>

      <p>
        A local legend says the waterfall is named after a beautiful girl called Shaki. 
        When a foreign conqueror tried to take her by force, she climbed to the top of 
        the cliff and jumped rather than surrender. As she fell, her long dress opened 
        and turned into a flowing cascade, and ever since the place has been called 
        Shaki Waterfall.
      </p>

      <p>
        Geologically, the falls were created where the Shaki River flows over an old 
        basalt lava flow on the side of the Vorotan gorge. The lava hardened into an 
        18‑metre step, and the water has been pouring over it ever since, filling the 
        air with mist and cool spray. On a hot summer day, standing near the falls 
        feels like stepping into natural air conditioning.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trail to the waterfall is short and not difficult, which makes Shaki a 
        perfect stop on the way to or from Tatev. You can walk right up to the rocks 
        beside the water, get a little wet, take dramatic photos and then sit for a 
        few minutes just watching the constant movement of the falls—it is the kind 
        of simple, vivid experience that stays in your memory long after the trip.

      <h3>Armenia’s “Machu Picchu” carved into the cliffs of Syunik</h3>

      <p>
        Old Khot is one of those places that make you stop and double‑check what you 
        are seeing. The ruins of an entire village are draped across a steep hillside, 
        with stone houses stacked one above another so that one family’s roof was 
        the neighbor’s courtyard. Below, the Vorotan Gorge drops away into a deep, 
        green canyon.
      </p>

      <p>
        People have lived here for many centuries. Ancient graves around the site 
        show that the area was inhabited long ago, and later records mention Khot 
        as a tax‑paying village under the powerful Tatev Monastery. The name itself 
        is linked to the greenery of the area—fields and gardens that once surrounded 
        the old village near the river.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the 20th century, life here became increasingly difficult: the road was 
        rough, winters were harsh, electricity arrived late, and access to the rest 
        of the region was complicated. Eventually, the villagers moved to a new, 
        flatter site above, leaving Old Khot as a stone ghost village. Today, walking 
        between the ruins feels like stepping into a frozen scene from a movie.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reaching Old Khot takes some effort, but the reward is a powerful mix of 
        landscape and history. Narrow paths wind between collapsed walls, doorways 
        open onto nothing but air, and every turn reveals another angle of the gorge 
        and the village clinging to its cliffs. If you love hidden, slightly wild 
        places with real stories etched into the stones, Old Khot is a must‑visit.

      <h3>A dramatic canyon, a natural stone bridge and hidden hot springs</h3>

      <p>
        Vorotan Gorge is one of the most dramatic landscapes in Syunik: the river cuts 
        deep into the plateau, creating steep cliffs and dizzying drops, while roads 
        and the Wings of Tatev cableway trace the rim above. From the viewpoints you 
        see the gorge open up in front of you and understand just how deep it really is.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the bottom of the canyon, directly beneath Tatev, lies Devil's Bridge, a 
        natural rock arch carved by the river over thousands of years. Today an asphalt 
        road runs across the top, while below the water squeezes through a narrow 
        passage between walls of stone. Early visitors who saw such a huge “bridge” 
        with no human builder decided it must be the work of the devil—hence the name.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hidden beneath the bridge are warm mineral springs and a series of small 
        natural pools. The mineral‑rich water has stained the rocks in shades of 
        green, yellow and orange, and steam rises on cool days. Adventurous visitors 
        climb down to soak in the pools, listening to the muffled sound of cars 
        overhead and the constant rush of the river beside them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vorotan Gorge and Devil's Bridge fit perfectly into the same day as Tatev and 
        the cableway. It is a place where you can combine sweeping canyon views from 
        above with close‑up encounters with water, rock and hot springs below—an ideal 
        stop if you want to feel the wilder side of southern Armenia.

      <h3>The Lori highlands, forests and canyons that shaped Armenia’s great storyteller</h3>

      <p>
        Dsegh is the kind of village where the landscape already feels like a story. 
        A high plateau drops off into a deep canyon, fields turn into forests, and 
        distant peaks fade into mist. It is easy to see why Hovhannes Tumanyan, 
        Armenia’s beloved writer and poet, was born right here.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the center of the village, Tumanyan’s house‑museum preserves the atmosphere 
        of his childhood home: a wooden balcony, simple rooms and objects that make 
        the worlds of “Anush”, “The Dog and the Cat” or “Gikor” feel much closer. 
        Step outside, and within a few minutes you are already on paths leading into 
        the fields and forests that inspired him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around Dsegh there are several marked trails and viewpoints: loop hikes that 
        wind through meadows and woodland, past springs and small stone bridges, and 
        eventually bring you to the edge of Debed Canyon. From there you look down 
        at the river far below and across to layers of green hills—especially beautiful 
        in autumn when the colors explode, and in summer when the forest offers cool shade.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to experience the quieter, more lyrical side of Armenia, Dsegh is 
        a perfect place to slow down. You do not need attractions or rides here: just 
        walk the village streets, sit on a bench near the canyon, listen to the wind 
        in the trees and understand why so many of Tumanyan’s lines feel like they 
        were written with this landscape in mind.

      <h3>A calm, windswept lake on the Shirak plateau</h3>

      <p>
        Lake Arpi is one of Armenia’s quiet northern lakes, spread across the open 
        Shirak plateau near the border with Georgia. There are no big resorts or 
        party beaches here—just water, wide skies, small villages and the feeling 
        that you are very far from city noise.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lake and its surroundings form a national park and an important habitat 
        for birds. In spring and summer you can see many species nesting and feeding 
        around the wetlands, while in autumn it becomes a stopover for migrating 
        flocks. For anyone interested in birdwatching—or simply in watching the sky— 
        Lake Arpi is a rewarding place to be.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lake is partly a man‑made reservoir, fed by rivers and mountain springs, 
        and has long been used for irrigation and agriculture. For visitors, though, 
        the main attraction is the sense of open space: the horizon stretches in all 
        directions, the waves move quietly in the wind, and the landscape feels 
        both simple and very large.
      </p>

      <p>
        A visit to Lake Arpi is more about escape than activity. You walk along the 
        shore, sit in the grass, listen to the wind and birds and watch the light 
        change on the water. If you want to see a different, less‑visited side of 
        Armenia—honest, understated and peaceful—this is an excellent place to add 
        to your route.

      <h3>A quiet, photogenic lake hidden in the forests of Dilijan</h3>

      <p>
        Gosh Lake is all about silence and reflection—literally. A small mountain 
        lake tucked deep inside Dilijan National Park, it sits in a natural bowl 
        of forest where the water often turns into a perfect mirror for trees and 
        clouds. There are no big cafés or loud crowds here, just hikers, campers 
        and people who deliberately chose the quieter path.
      </p>

      <p>
        To reach the lake you follow a forest trail: soft earth, roots, rocks, 
        small streams and patches of moss. Compared to Parz Lake, which is very 
        easy to access, Gosh Lake feels more like a little adventure—you have to 
        walk and earn it, and that effort is exactly what keeps the atmosphere 
        peaceful when you arrive.
      </p>

      <p>
        In autumn the hillsides around the lake explode in shades of yellow, orange 
        and red, all of which end up doubled in the water. In spring everything is 
        bright green, and in summer the lake becomes a perfect rest stop on longer 
        hikes: a place to sit down, eat something, dip your feet in the water and 
        let your heartbeat slow down.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have already visited Parz Lake and want to experience Dilijan’s 
        wilder side, Gosh Lake is the next logical step. It is the kind of spot 
        where you can easily lose track of time—especially if you sit quietly on 
        the shore and watch the forest slowly paint and repaint itself on the 
        surface of the water.

      <h3>The “Mermaid’s Hair” waterfall in Armenia’s famous spa town</h3>

      <p>
        Jermuk Waterfall is one of Armenia’s most distinctive waterfalls. The water 
        drops around 70 meters from a rocky ledge and splits into dozens of thin 
        streams that slide down the cliff like strands of hair. It is this look that 
        inspired its local nickname: the “Mermaid’s Hair” waterfall.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to legend, a water maiden once lived here and fell in love with a 
        mortal. When she was forbidden to see him, she chose to disappear into the 
        rock, and only her long hair remained, flowing forever as the waterfall. 
        Standing close to the cascade, watching the fine streams glide over the 
        stone, it is easy to understand how such a story was born.
      </p>

      <p>
        The waterfall lies in a narrow gorge just below the spa town of Jermuk. 
        Above are sanatoriums, hot springs and parks; below, the landscape suddenly 
        becomes wild, with steep cliffs and the Arpa River rushing through the 
        canyon. From the bridge and viewpoints you get impressive angles of both 
        the falls and the gorge.
      </p>

      <p>
        A visit to Jermuk works best as a mix of wellness and nature: spend time in 
        the spa, taste the mineral waters at the gallery, and then walk down to the 
        waterfall to feel cool mist on your face. It is one of those places where 
        photos are nice, but being there—listening to the water and feeling the 
        scale of the cliff—leaves a much stronger impression.

      <h3>Armenia’s window into deep space on the slopes of Aragats</h3>

      <p>
        The Byurakan Observatory is where Armenia’s mountains meet the stars. 
        Perched on the slopes of Mount Aragats near the village of Byurakan, the 
        observatory looks like a small scientific town: telescope domes scattered 
        among trees and low buildings, all designed to study the night sky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Founded in the mid‑20th century and led for many years by the famous 
        astronomer Viktor Ambartsumian, Byurakan played a major role in Soviet and 
        international astronomy. Important stellar and galactic catalogs were 
        compiled here, and the observatory hosted scientists from all over the 
        world. Today it still operates as a research center and also opens its 
        doors to visitors.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the day you can walk around the grounds, see different domes up 
        close and hear stories about the discoveries made here. On guided visits, 
        it is sometimes possible to step inside and see some of the telescopes, 
        getting a sense of what it is like to work nights in this quiet, high‑altitude 
        setting with the sky as your main companion.
      </p>

      <p>
        At night the observatory becomes truly magical: city lights are far away, 
        the air is clear, and the Milky Way often stretches visibly across the sky. 
        If you are interested in space, science or just stargazing under a really 
        dark sky, Byurakan is one of the most memorable places you can visit in Armenia.

      <h3>Protected semi-desert, forest and waterfalls on the edge of Ararat valley</h3>

      <p>
        Khosrov Forest State Reserve is one of Armenia’s oldest protected areas, 
        where semi-desert hills, rocky gorges, forested slopes and small waterfalls 
        all meet within the same landscape.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reserve is not a regular open national park, but there are specific 
        public trails and guided routes that visitors can join, including hikes 
        toward Astghik and Vahagn waterfalls and routes that link the Garni area 
        with the outer parts of the reserve.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because this is a strictly protected zone, you are expected to stay on 
        marked paths, follow your guide’s instructions and avoid fires, littering 
        or disturbing wildlife. In return, you get a few hours of very raw nature: 
        cliffs, canyons, rare plants and wide views over the Ararat region.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have already seen Garni and want to push a bit deeper into Armenia’s 
        wild side without committing to a multi-day trek, the accessible trails of 
        Khosrov Reserve are an ideal next step: fewer cars, more rock and silence, 
        and a strong sense of being far from any city.

        <span class="sight-address">📍 Vagharshapat, Armavir Province</span>

      </div>
      <h3>A circular cathedral that now survives as a luminous ruin</h3>

      <p>
        Zvartnots Cathedral stands in an open field near Vagharshapat, where a ring
        of broken columns and arches rises under the sky and, on clear days, Mount
        Ararat appears on the horizon.
        Even in ruins it feels surprisingly modern and experimental, as if it were
        a bold architectural project ahead of its time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project is associated with Catholicos Nerses, often called “the Builder”,
        who wanted a unique circular cathedral that could host important ceremonies
        and receive high-ranking guests.
        Zvartnots was conceived less as a village church and more as a symbolic
        centerpiece for the Etchmiadzin area.
      </p>

      <h3>Name and idea of light</h3>
      <p>
        The name “Zvartnots” is linked to the word “zvart”, meaning joyful or bright,
        and to the idea of “zvartats”, the heavenly hosts or angels, which gives
        the name a sense of “dwelling place of the angels”.
        With its circular plan, open colonnades and light filtering from above,
        the cathedral was designed as a space where architecture and light work
        together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many guides like to say that Zvartnots is more about light than walls, and
        even today, in its ruined state, that feeling is still very present.
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture and appearance</h3>
      <p>
        Zvartnots is known for its circular ground plan and several concentric
        rings of columns that once supported a high central structure.
        The reconstructed outlines of the foundations and the surviving carved
        blocks give visitors a good sense of the original volume.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around the site you can see finely carved capitals, friezes and khachkars,
        which show how richly decorated the cathedral must have been.
      </p>

      <h3>Ruin, museum and UNESCO</h3>
      <p>
        Over time the cathedral collapsed and remained a ruin until archaeological
        excavations uncovered the foundations and many architectural fragments.
        Today Zvartnots is an open-air museum with a small indoor exhibition that
        displays finds, models and drawings of different reconstructions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together with the cathedral and churches of Etchmiadzin, Zvartnots is part
        of a single UNESCO World Heritage Site and is usually visited on the same
        day as the Mother Cathedral, Saint Hripsime and Saint Gayane.

      <h3>Stairs, art and the panorama of Yerevan</h3>

      <p>
        The Cascade is much more than a long staircase – it is an entire architectural complex
        that connects Yerevan’s city center with Victory Park and the Mother Armenia statue on the hill.
        From the lower part, next to Tamanyan Square and the cafes, you walk up through terraces,
        small fountains and flowerbeds, and from the top you get one of the classic views over Yerevan
        with the city’s rooftops and Mount Ararat on the horizon on clear days.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project started in Soviet times as a mostly functional way to link different levels of the city,
        but over the years the Cascade has turned into Yerevan’s open-air balcony.
        Locals and visitors come here to take photos, watch the sunset, sit on the steps and simply feel
        the city moving and buzzing under their feet.
      </p>

      <h3>Alexander Tamanyan and the shape of the city</h3>
      <p>
        At the bottom of the Cascade stands the statue of architect Alexander Tamanyan, the author of
        Yerevan’s 20th‑century master plan who transformed the city from a small provincial town into a
        capital with wide avenues, squares and a clearly structured center.
        Many of the ideas people now associate with Yerevan – the circular city center, the composition
        of Republic Square and the visual opening towards Ararat – go back to his planning work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tamanyan was known for his love of clean lines and natural stone, and for his sense of proportion
        so that buildings and public spaces never felt too heavy.
        The Cascade may look massive at first glance, but its rhythm of terraces breaks it down into
        smaller human‑scale plazas where each landing feels like its own little square with benches and a view.
      </p>

      <h3>Contemporary art inside the stairs</h3>
      <p>
        Inside the Cascade you will find a contemporary art center with large exhibition halls, staircases
        and installations spread over several levels, often hosting both Armenian and international artists.
        Outside, on Tamanyan Square in front of the Cascade, modern sculptures under the open sky have turned
        the area into one of the most popular meeting points in the city.
      </p>

      <p>
        If it is your first time in Yerevan, the Cascade is one of the best places to start:
        in the morning it is quieter and perfect for walking all the way up, while in the evening
        the combination of people sitting on the steps, live music and city lights captures a lot of
        what makes Yerevan feel alive.

      <h3>Where the alphabet turns into a building</h3>

      <p>
        Matenadaran sits at the top of Mashtots Avenue like a stone fortress of books:
        massive basalt walls outside, and inside – one of the world’s richest collections of
        Armenian manuscripts, miniatures and archival documents.
        On the square in front you are greeted by the statue of Mesrop Mashtots, the creator
        of the Armenian alphabet, together with his student Koriun, which already sets the mood
        for a place built entirely around the idea of writing and memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        The collection includes thousands of handwritten volumes from different centuries:
        Gospels, scientific works, medical treatises, maps, music notation and even
        multicolored miniature illustrations where each page feels like a tiny universe.
        Many manuscripts survived wars, fires and long journeys and now are preserved here
        in carefully controlled conditions, often with detailed stories about how they were saved.
      </p>

      <h3>Inside the halls of manuscripts</h3>
      <p>
        The main exhibition halls show a curated selection of the most important works:
        early examples of the Armenian alphabet, illuminated pages under glass, and books
        that are famous not only for their text but also for their calligraphy and artwork.
        Information panels and guided tours help to decode what you are seeing, from the
        meaning of certain symbols to the way parchment was prepared and pigments were made.

        Beyond the showcases, Matenadaran is also a research institute, where specialists
        work with the manuscripts on a daily basis – restoring, digitizing and studying them.
        Even if you are not a historian, walking through these rooms gives a strong sense of how
        much effort it took to write and keep knowledge before printing and the internet.

      <h3>A quiet viewpoint above the avenue</h3>
      <p>
        The steps and terraces in front of Matenadaran are a small viewpoint of their own:
        from here you can look down Mashtots Avenue towards the city center and, on clear days,
        sometimes even see Ararat between the buildings.
        It is a good place to sit for a few minutes after the museum visit, let all the
        information sink in and watch everyday Yerevan flow below.

        If you are interested in history, language or just want to understand why the Armenian
        alphabet is such an important part of identity here, Matenadaran is a must‑see stop in Yerevan.
        It works equally well as a deep dive with a guided tour or as a shorter visit to walk through
        the main halls and feel the atmosphere of a house built for books.
