      <h2>Garni Pagan Temple</h2>
      <h3>1st‑century temple in the Artaxiad summer residence</h3>

      <p>
        The temple of Garni was built in the 1st century and was dedicated to
        the sun god Mihr. It is the only fully preserved Hellenistic‑style
        pagan temple in Armenia, with Ionic columns and a high podium.
      </p>

      <p>
        The temple was part of a royal summer residence complex with baths,
        reception halls and defensive walls, and below it opens the view of the
        Azat gorge and the “Symphony of Stones” basalt columns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today Garni is one of Armenia’s most famous sights, a venue for open‑air
        concerts, festivals and events where ancient architecture meets
        contemporary culture.

      <h2>Lake Sevan</h2>
      <h3>The “jewel of Armenia” – a high‑mountain lake at 1900 m</h3>

      <p>
        Lake Sevan is Armenia’s largest body of water and one of the biggest
        high‑altitude freshwater lakes in the world. It lies at about
        1900 meters above sea level and is often called the “jewel of Armenia”
        or the country’s “blue eye”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lake Sevan is like Armenia’s blue eye: a huge mirror set between
        mountains that changes color with the time of day and the seasons –
        pale blue in the morning, bright and sparkling at noon, and glowing
        crimson at sunset.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lake is surrounded by mountain ranges, while its shores are lined
        with beaches, resorts and small villages. Here you can swim, go out
        on a boat, relax in tiny bays with wooden huts and floating decks, and
        listen to the wind moving the waves while familiar mountains close the
        horizon on all sides. You can camp on the shore and try famous Sevan
        trout and other local fish dishes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Locals like to say that Sevan “looks at people” like an eye and that
        the weather changes with its mood: on calm days the lake is smooth as
        a mirror, while during storms it seems offended and sends high waves
        crashing onto the shore. At night the stars feel so close to the water
        that it seems you could almost reach out and pick them up.

      <h2>Parz Lake</h2>
      <h3>A small mountain lake in the heart of Dilijan National Park</h3>

      <p>
        Parz Lake is a small mountain lake hidden in the forests of Dilijan National Park,
        at about 1,330 meters above sea level. Its calm, mirror-like surface
        reflects the surrounding trees and sky, which makes it one of the most photogenic
        spots in the area.
      </p>

      <p>
        A gentle loop trail of roughly 2 km goes around the lake, so you can take an easy
        walk, stop at viewpoints and watch how the forest slowly descends all the way down
        to the water. The path is suitable even for non-experienced hikers,
        which makes Parz Lake a good option for light hiking and family-friendly walks.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the lakeshore there are small cafés, picnic spots and pavilions, and in season
        you can rent a boat or pedal boat to see the forest and mountains from the water
        itself. Many visitors bring their own snacks or picnic,
        sit close to the water and simply listen to the sounds of the forest – birds,
        wind and the quiet splash of the lake.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spring, the hills around Parz Lake turn bright green, while in autumn the forest
        becomes a mix of gold and red tones. Even in summer it usually feels
        cooler here than in the city, so an hour by the lake often feels like a whole day
        of real rest.
