      <h2>Garni Pagan Temple</h2>
      <h3>1st‑century temple in the Artaxiad summer residence</h3>

      <p>
        The temple of Garni was built in the 1st century and was dedicated to
        the sun god Mihr. It is the only fully preserved Hellenistic‑style
        pagan temple in Armenia, with Ionic columns and a high podium.
      </p>

      <p>
        The temple was part of a royal summer residence complex with baths,
        reception halls and defensive walls, and below it opens the view of the
        Azat gorge and the “Symphony of Stones” basalt columns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today Garni is one of Armenia’s most famous sights, a venue for open‑air
        concerts, festivals and events where ancient architecture meets
        contemporary culture.

      <h2>Lake Sevan</h2>
      <h3>The “jewel of Armenia” – a high‑mountain lake at 1900 m</h3>

      <p>
        Lake Sevan is Armenia’s largest body of water and one of the biggest
        high‑altitude freshwater lakes in the world. It lies at about
        1900 meters above sea level and is often called the “jewel of Armenia”
        or the country’s “blue eye”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lake Sevan is like Armenia’s blue eye: a huge mirror set between
        mountains that changes color with the time of day and the seasons –
        pale blue in the morning, bright and sparkling at noon, and glowing
        crimson at sunset.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lake is surrounded by mountain ranges, while its shores are lined
        with beaches, resorts and small villages. Here you can swim, go out
        on a boat, relax in tiny bays with wooden huts and floating decks, and
        listen to the wind moving the waves while familiar mountains close the
        horizon on all sides. You can camp on the shore and try famous Sevan
        trout and other local fish dishes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Locals like to say that Sevan “looks at people” like an eye and that
        the weather changes with its mood: on calm days the lake is smooth as
        a mirror, while during storms it seems offended and sends high waves
        crashing onto the shore. At night the stars feel so close to the water
        that it seems you could almost reach out and pick them up.
